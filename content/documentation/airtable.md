## Getting to the Airtable database

Log in to [Airtable](airtable.com) with WMA credentials, and select the "WMA Program Committee Data" database. You should see a spreadsheet with several tabs across the front. You will mostly be concerned with the "submissions" and "pc_members" tables.

## submissions

As submissions come in through the online form, they will show up on the "submissions" tab. As an administrator, you will mostly be working with the first four fields: "round_number", "program_year", "session_id", and "assigned_to". These fields should all be blank when the proposals are initially submitted.

* __round_number__ ensures that the proposal is correctly sorted into the "[round 1](3/proposals/#round-1)" and "[round 2](/proposals/#round-2)" sections of the "[All Proposals](/proposals/)" page. These values are selected from a drop-down list, but can be copied and pasted all at once as well.
* __program_year:__ Blah
