## Getting to the Airtable database

Log in to [Airtable](airtable.com) with WMA credentials, and select the "WMA Program Committee Data" database. You should see a spreadsheet with several tabs across the front. You will mostly be concerned with the "submissions" and "pc_members" tables.

Before you start making changes to the data, I recommend you create a backup of the database by hovering over the lower-right-hand corner of the "Wm" database icon and selecting "Duplicate base."

## Submissions

As submissions come in through the online form, they will show up on the "submissions" tab. As an administrator, you will mostly be working with the first four fields: "round_number", "program_year", "session_id", and "assigned_to". These fields should all be blank when the proposals are initially submitted.

* __round_number__ ensures that the proposal is correctly sorted into the "[round 1](3/proposals/#round-1)" and "[round 2](/proposals/#round-2)" sections of the "[All Proposals](/proposals/)" page. These values are selected from a drop-down list, but can be copied and pasted all at once as well.
* __program_year:__ Adding the current program year to a submission in the table will trigger a process to add the submission to the website. Only add the current year to the program when you are ready to do this. As with the round number, the program year can be pasted into multiple rows of the table at once.
* __session_id:__ The session ID is added manually, and usually follows the format "WMA2021_001" for regular proposals, and "WMA2020_WK4" for workshops.
* __assigned_to:__ This is how you will assign program committee members to a proposal for review. Click in the field, press the "plus" button, and select the appropriate committee member. _(See "Program Committee Members", below, for more info on this.)_
