## Logging in

Log in at [https://pc.westmuse.org/admin](https://pc.westmuse.org/admin) using the credentials that were sent to your e-mail address.

## Adding files for download

All downloadable files should be added to the site via the "Media" button in the upper-left-hand corner of the admin interface. You can add or delete files from here.

Once you have added a file to the media repository, you can link to this file from another page by using the URL structure /files/nameofyourfile.ext. If you've added a file titled "wma2019-survy-results.pdf" to the media library, for instance, you would link to this file from within the site using the URL [/files/wma2019-survey-results.pdf](/files/wma2019-survey-results.pdf).

## Collections

The "collections" on the left side of the admin correspond to the main sections of the website. Because program committee members and the proposals themselves are added & edited via the Airtable database, they are not included here.

* Use __Welcome__ to edit the home page.
* Use __Program Committee Docs__ to edit all pages in the "Documents and Downloads" and "Reviewing Guidelines & Process" sectons.
* Use __Timelines and Agendas__ to edit all pages under the "Timelines & Meeting Agendas" section.

## Editing content

Once you select a collection, you will see all of the editable pages in a list. These pages will correspond to the same list you see on the PC site when first clicking through to a section. You can add a new page by selecting the gray button in the upper-right-hand corner of the page list. This button will be named differently depending on its context; it may read as "New Timelines and Agendas" or "New Program Committee Docs".

Once you have selected a page to edit, or have created a new page, you can edit the page using the CMS interface. In most cases, you will only ever need to edit the "Body" section of the page. I recommend selecting the "Rich Text" switch, if it isn't already selected.

Once you are ready to commit your changes, click the green "Publish" button in the upper-right-hand corner of the page.
