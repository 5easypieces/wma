  Undertaking major changes to programming can be a challenging exercise for
  museums. The Chandler Museum, Nora Eccles Harrison Museum of Art, and Heard
  Museum have each endeavored to move beyond the walls of their building and
  find ways to engage with new audiences. Whether through renovation or
  reorganization, you will learn the importance of early and continued
  engagement with stakeholders and how their input can help guide programming in
  a positive and unexpected way.  
uniqueness: >-
  We'll look at how to position museums for future expansion, the strategic role
  of non-traditional programming, and extending user experiences beyond the
  building's four walls.
objectives: >-
  1. Understand the role stakeholder engagement plays in programming, and
  present strategies for continuing to listen and engage long after the ribbon
  has been cut.

  2. Identify and explore the hidden potential of non-traditional museum assets.
  For example, programming outdoor spaces in creative ways, the use of light
  technology as a means for deepening visitor engagement.

  3. Evaluate whether strategies were successful, or how they could have been
  improved. Utilize visitor surveys to demonstrate how data can inform future
  decision making and programming.
engagement: >-
  Moderator introduces the topic, guides the conversation with three panel
  speakers. Powerpoint will be used to engage the audience. Moderator controlled
  Q&A interspersed throughout. Engagement of the audience is vital to the
  success of this discussion.

  needs of the theme for the conference.

  All three projects relied heavily on stakeholder and community engagement
  during the predesign phase. Significant time was spent learning why
  stakeholders didn't visit the museum, which led to follow-up discussions on
  how programming and strategic relationships could help improve attendance. 
  This effort was made in the design phase to engage new audiences, and
  presenters will share visitor feedback and data to illustrate the successful
  outcome of engaging new audiences, as well as the challenges.
