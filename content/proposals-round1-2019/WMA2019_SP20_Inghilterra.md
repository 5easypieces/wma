description: 'Professional conservators are essential to collections care, but facing the realities of limited budgets and needy artifacts, when can (or should) museum staff provide a little DIY? Throughout the rebuilding of the Idaho State Museum, collaborative partnerships between collections staff and professional conservators opened up new possibilities for both collections stewardship and professional engagement. Join a discussion about the line between ''DIY'' and ''do not touch'' to better care for the artifacts that need us! '
uniqueness: 'As a case study, ISM''s partnerships provide models for collaborative practices of engagement between collections staff and conservators.'
objectives: 'Our primary objective is to encourage collections personnel to form close partnerships with conservators to better care for stewarded artifacts. Additionally, we would like to present strategies that helped our team succeed in maximizing both budgets and staff skills. While this is by no means a suggestion that museums don?t need professional conservators, it was surprising to us just how much we could accomplish with the encouragement and guidance of experts. Like many museums, the ISM only had a particular amount of money set aside for conservation. Our needs exceeded that amount exponentially. After talking to local conservators, the idea that we could in fact, do some of this work in-house was surprising. The bulk of literature suggests a far more hands off approach and instead calls for professional conservation in most cases when damage is present. Working with Diana and Cheri brought to light just how much we could do, which better allowed us to prioritize those artifacts or injuries we couldn?t tackle independently. This model may be already present in other institutions, or could be latent in communities with similar circumstances. I would hope that attendees would leave the discussion ready to find opportunities to engage these relationships and skills back home resulting in happier, healthier, artifacts all around! '
engagement: 'This will be a conversation guided by Jody Ochoa. The session would begin with a brief introduction from Jody describing the framework for the collections department during the ISM remodel. Sarah and I would then present short summaries of the restoration of the Owyhee Dome and the Textiles Digitization Initiative, bringing in Diana with her contributions and guidance. After moderator facilitated discussion, we would then incorporate Q&A dialogue with the audience.'
additional_comments: 'Totally willing to merge with another session or include other presenters!'

theme_relationship: 'These case studies represent the engagement of both staff members and the community of professionals surrounding the ISM. Instead of serving as a way to bypass the need for professional conservators, engaging them as mentors and community members provides an opportunity to maximize our outreach and collections stewardship.

  reason: With over 30 years of experience in the field, Jody is a wealth of knowledge! She also supervised the partnership between ISM staff and conservators, which makes her uniquely situated to guide this discussion in particular. Jody would be able to describe the environment surrounding the projects discussed and would be able to address some of the practical concerns regarding how resources were allocated.

  reason: Sarah took on the bulk of the conservation and cleaning of the stained glass Owyhee Dome under the guidance of Cheri Lindley of Lindley Glass Studio. Sarah?s partnership with Cheri was highly productive and in instances of more substantial repair, Cheri stepped in. The process of restoration was one of Sarah?s primary tasks after it was taken off exhibit and was a several years long endeavor. After completion and reinstallation, the dome once again serves as a signature piece in the Idaho State Museum thanks to Sarah and Cheri?s work and stewardship.

  is_confirmed: FALSE
  reason: ISM has enlisted Diana several times as a conservator for multiple types of artifacts, most recently to conserve textile pieces. During the course of the ISM textile digitization initiative and ISM redesign, her consultation regarding the stabilization and conservation of several delicate pieces, which would not have been digitized or displayed due to their condition, was instrumental. She consulted on specific techniques used, materials, and planned methods of approach for several repairs and assisted in advising how to construct mounts and displays that would support the stabilized pieces.

  reason: Throughout the Textiles Digitization Initiative, Nicole worked on selection, research, and presentation of over 400 dress artifacts for digitization. However, many were in varying states of disrepair ranging from small tears to substantial loss. With Diana?s encouragement and guidance, Nicole and other staff members undertook conservation and stabilization of many artifacts so they could be digitized and later installed in the new museum. Two garments were chosen to receive more in depth care in Diana?s studio while an additional piece was reassembled in-house after consultation with Diana.
