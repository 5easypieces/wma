description: 'Museums do so much to protect cultural heritage from the known environment, but what about the unknown? How can we best prepare for natural (or unnatural) disasters that we didn?t see coming? What are the first action steps we need to do to minimize damage? This session will walk through creating a disaster preparedness plan for your institution, provide resources for emergencies, and help you know how to react when disaster strikes. '
uniqueness: 'Disasters in museums are not in themselves unique, but surviving them may be. This session will give hands on examples to prepare museum staff in the event of an emergency.'
objectives: "Objectives: Learn what resources are available for museums in the event of a disaster. Learn to create detailed disaster response plans. Have directions on how to react at the start of the disaster to hopefully minimize damage to collections (if possible).\n*Outcomes: The attendees will be broken into groups and asked to apply what they learned in the session to tackle disaster examples given to them. Attendees will leave with disaster plans started for their institutions and directions on implementing their plans. "
engagement: 'The session will begin with speakers talking about resources, planning, and what can be done to minimize damage in a disaster. The attendees will then be broken into groups and given a disaster example to mitigate. Solutions will be shared with the whole group at the end. Take aways will include resources, contacts for disaster ''aid'', as well as an outline for creating a disaster preparedness plan for their institution. '
additional_comments: 'May need help with additional presenters.'

theme_relationship: 'In light of the disaster and tragedy of Brazil and the eminent threat to Western US museums in the form of wildfires, earthquakes, and flooding, it is critical that museums engage in the safety of their collections. If we do not, there will be no content in which to engage the public.  '
