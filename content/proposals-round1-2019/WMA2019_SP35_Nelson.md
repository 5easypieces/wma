categories: ["All levels from emerging professional to leadership"]
tags: [" The session will be applicable to all museum professionals", "including museum directors and those that focus on facilities. " ]
description: "Since 1980, the chance of major floods, hurricanes, wild fires or other severe weather events has increased by 300%. This session introduces resilient design and provides tools and applications for small to large museums to identify and reduce risk.  Attendees will participate in a hands-on workshop utilizing a planning tool to assess, prioritize and plan for resiliency."
uniqueness: "This session will provide tangible resources for attendees, including hands-on demonstration and access to a resiliency planning tool."
objectives: "1. Attendees will learn about the increasing risks of severe weather events and urgency in planning for resilience. Resiliency planning is a process of forecasting risks, assessing likelihood and impact, and planning to mitigate those risks. This session introduces the resilient planning process and how it might apply to museums of all sizes. 
*2. Attendees will learn about practical applications to mitigate climate change based on a case study. The Science Museum of Minnesota has had great success in cutting their contributions to carbon dioxide pollution by more than 30 percent in just four years as well as reducing heating and cooling costs by 38 percent. Attendees will learn how the museum has embraced their environmental responsibility and is sharing their success story to help others.
*3. Attendees will take away a customizable planning tool for resiliency planning.  This session will share resources and a planning tool that can help museums of all sizes identify and prepare for potentially catastrophic events. Embedding resiliency planning will benefit existing institutions, as well as those planning for renovation of new facility."
engagement: "75-minute session: The session will begin with a presentation introducing resiliency planning and the increased risk posed by a changing climate. A case study will be presented based on the Science Museum of Minnesota's success in cutting carbon emissions and focusing on practical solutions to mitigating risks. A resiliency planning tool will be introduced and will involve hands-on break-out session (ideally at round tables in the room), followed by a share-out and wrap-up at the end. "
additional_comments: "We are open to revising our session, incorporating in additional presenters or merging. "
other_comments: "This resource will directly benefit those from small institutions to achieve a practical approach to planning for the future without the need for numerous resources or staff."
theme_relationship: "This session will emphasize the partnership and community aspect of planning for resiliency. Many resilient design plans involve multiple entities coming together to solve issues as a community that would be impossible to manage on a single institution."
