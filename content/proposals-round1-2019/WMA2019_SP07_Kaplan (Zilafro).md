  ENGAGE your future in capital project planning: “If I knew back then, what I
  know now…”

    Museum directors and/or senior facilities or operations-focused teams. OR:
    Anyone whose institution is considering or in the planning phases of a
    capital project.
description: >-
  Most museum leaders have limited experience with capital design and
  construction projects, yet in a capital project find themselves in design and
  planning meetings where they are making decisions that will impact the
  institution for decades. This session will help leaders and facility managers
  understand the ramifications of some key decisions on things like cost of
  operation, staffing, sustainability, revenue generation, and programmatic
  flexibility, so that they can balance these impacts with the up-front cost of
  alternative design, mechanical, or material choices.
uniqueness: >-
  Past capital planning sessions have generally focused on design for aesthetics
  or cost, or as far as they have impacted visitorship. This session will give
  attendees practical decision-making insights that touch bottom line and
  institutional mission.
objectives: >-
  1. Help attendees understand upfront cost vs. ongoing operational cost
  implications of things like i.e.: MEP systems, layout vis a vis staffing
  requirements, etc…so that they know what questions to ask.

  2. Design decisions that affect curatorial and exhibition flexibility (i.e.
  types of exhibitions, ability to host traveling exhibitions, etc…)

  3. Design decisions that may affect revenue generation opportunities (i.e.
  flexible space and/or event-friendly space, cost of including items like prep
  kitchens vs. revenue upside, etc…)
engagement: >-
  Three museum decision-makers will follow, each having completed a project in
  the last 5 years, and each will take a formal “look-back” at these decisions
  and others, and specific lessons learned in the process. A museum construction
  expert (Bart Shively) will share a brief overview of typical alternative
  design and mechanical decisions that he encounters in museum projects of all
  sizes. Bart will compare upfront to long-term operating costs and other
  impacts of such systems and decisions, lending insights from the cost and
  client experience side. The facilitator will provoke the audience and museum
  panel to consider and reconsider how their decisions, which may be cost- or
  operations-based up front, will impact those costs and operations in the long
  run, etc…

  We’re having no problem finding panelists, just the time for the
  conversations. The final presenter (not yet confirmed) will either be from the
  Petersen Automotive Museum or the Exploratorium, both of whom are at least a
  couple of years post-renovation. NHMU has collected “If I did it again”
  recommendations for the last 20 years from directors who have opened new
  facilities, which they used heavily throughout planning, design, construction,
  and opening phases—we will combine that w/MATT’s running document on the
  subject, and distribute those to all attendees.

  Part of the advice that will be discussed will be a directive and method of
  engaging the entire institution across the diversity of departments when
  making these design decisions, understanding that each decision has long-term
  ramifications on every department and person on staff.

    James has led over 3 institutions through the planning and construction
    phases of major capital projects, and as such has tremendous perspective
    looking back at the impacts of design decisions on the institution from a
    director’s perspective.

    Bart has worked in the trenches of planning and building many museums for
    MATT Construction, large and small. He has extensive experience with
    alternative MEP systems, storage solutions, and the kinds of design
    decisions that are evaluated by museums using world-renowned architects, as
    they weigh these decisions against current and future costs to the
    institution. He will be able to frame the discussion in practical terms
    generally, which will lead well into the specific “how did it play out”
    conversation by the museum panelists.

    The Idaho State Museum completed its major construction project in the last
    two years, and they have a fresh perspective on how design decisions
    affected the institution holistically. Janet will present some tools that
    they created to make design decisions, an early look-back that discusses
    their decisions and unexpected follow-ups related to geothermal energy, ADA
    design, new personnel requirements, and the operational cost of running
    electrical multi-media systems that were chosen in the design phase.

    7 years later, Dr. George has a lot to say about how the institution’s
    design decisions have played out on the operational costs, programmatic
    considerations, staffing, and other aspects of the museum’s operations. Dr.
    George will discuss: how important the architectural program was to getting
    a design that functions appropriately; how a strong business plan gives you
    good estimates of audience sizes so you can size your space appropriately;
    how important it is to get a tough business planner to give you a dose of
    reality so you don’t over-hire at opening; how many systems cost more up
    front but save you money later (MEP, electronics, landscaping, etc etc etc).
