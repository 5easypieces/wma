  Have you completed a collections move and found yourself left with a plethora
  of foam, polyester fiberfill, and boxes that you would happily share with
  another institution? Or maybe you're moving out of a space and have storage
  furniture that you can no longer use? Repurposing archival materials and
  museum furniture takes time and effort, which is often not built into our job
  descriptions. As stewards of cultural heritage we must be conscious of
  protecting our environment by not creating unnecessary waste. This session
  will focus on creative and efficient ways to share unwanted goods through
  community resources, furniture vendors, social media, and online classifieds.
uniqueness: >-
  This session encourages museum professionals to consider the long-term
  repercussions of throwing away lightly-used materials and furniture. Beyond
  using consumer recycling programs this session will encourage museum
  professionals to leverage their existing networks and create new networks to
  share expensive, custom materials that are unique to our industry.
objectives: >-
  Session attendees will: 


  1. Feel empowered to repurpose materials

  2. Have access to existing networks for sharing museum materials

  3. Understand how to create their own local networks using models that other
  museum professionals have already created
engagement: >-
  The session will feature three speakers who will each present for 15 minutes.
  Speakers will share recent experience they have had with repurposing materials
  and highlight the resources they created or used. The remainder of the session
  will be filled by the moderator who will introduce the speakers as well as
  summarize the main take-aways at the end of the session. The session will end
  with a Q&A. Although still to be developed, I would like to create a recycling
  activity or challenge for participants to do, either at the conference or the
  moment they return to their museum. 
additional_comments: >-
  I have two speakers confirmed. For the third speaker I would like to include a
  furniture vendor who has helped museums find used furniture, bought back used
  furniture, or helped repurpose existing furniture. I?m hoping there is a
  vendor who is planning to be in the Expo Hall.

  Recycling and repurposing materials requires collaboration. When cultural
  institutions share goods they are forging new relationships, learning about
  other institutions' material standards, and connecting with their community
  and local businesses.

    After spending six months trying to repurpose over 500 light canisters and
    lenses that were no longer needed at SFMOMA, I learned a lot about the
    benefits and challenges of recycling museum materials. During this project I
    reached out to colleagues to hear about their systems and struggles. As the
    primary contact and moderator for this session I?m able to bring together
    knowledgeable speakers as well as summarize the main take-ways from the
    session.

    Katie was instrumental in a four-year long collections move for the Hearst
    Museum. At the end of the move Katie and her team found themselves with an
    excess of packing materials that they couldn’t use and didn’t want to put in
    the dumpster. Katie reached out to community organizations and utilized
    online classifieds to creatively repurpose materials.
