  This session will focus on fostering different kinds of community and
  inter-agency partnerships to engage existing audiences and cultivate new ones.
  Additionally, panelists will discuss the process of developing and retaining
  partner relationships of all kinds. Relationship building can be tough, but it
  is also an integral part of lasting partnerships. Learn how different
  background and different missions can come together for mutually beneficial
  outcomes!
uniqueness: >-
  Treating partnerships in the context of relationship-building creates a
  shared, vested interest in a program’s success. This session will outline how
  to build those relationships.
objectives: |-
  1. Identify how successful partnerships begin.
  2. Demonstrate how to anticipate and plan for hiccups and roadblocks.
  3. Outline how to make the partnership last.
engagement: >-
  This would be a standard session with panelists discussing their partnerships.
  Since each deals with a different kind of relationship we would do a breakout
  time. Asking the audience to choose which partnership (relationship) they want
  to “commit” too. They would then ask questions, outline, strategize with that
  panelist in particular. The idea being those like-minded directions can learn
  and grow with each other to maximize their museums potential.
additional_comments: >-
  This could easily be a stand-alone session or merged with a similar
  session(s). If merged there might be a need to pare down committed panelists.
  Always open to making it the strongest session possible
other_comments: >-
  An essential part of lasting partnerships is understanding they can form
  anywhere with anyone.
theme_relationship: >-
  The session is all about museums engaging with our community to benefit common
  and/or newly developed missions and purposes. Relationship building within
  these partnerships requires a commitment to the each other and engaging each
  other for a shared good.
