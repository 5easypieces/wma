    The Classroom Enrichment program is a partnership with local schools and the
    Sun Valley Center of the Arts that integrates the arts into secondary core
    subjects, such as math, science, social studies, and English to bolster
    curriculum by working with teachers and students in a creative process,
    providing an opportunity for students to approach a topic in a new way,
    increase exploration of the topic, and deepen the discussion on a given
    subject. As an art therapist and art educator, Jordyn is interested in
    developing opportunities for students to expand their ideas surrounding
    successful learning.
