  The need to define both 'Digital Content' and 'Digital Strategy' are essential
  for any organization. In doing so, the Lifecycle of Digital Content becomes
  more transparent--and easier to wrangle.
uniqueness: >-
  How museums can use digital projects to break down department silos and build
  content with multiple applications and surprising uses.
objectives: >-
  Pressed with the need to expand our Internet Presence with limited funding and
  staffing, we decided to create a tool to aggregate content across our existing
  platforms. Additionally, faced with aging kiosks and wayfinding signs, we
  decided to also use the platform for digital signs, interactive wayfinding,
  and even specifically-themed kiosk designs within the galleries. In 2019, it
  will also serve as a repository for interactive materials to supplement our
  Skype in the Classroom lessons. Aside from discussing some of the specific
  technologies we think might be of interest to others, we also think our
  methodology is worth sharing. Instead of assembling one large group to try and
  agree on a single idea, we built the software in loosely-connected modules
  over several years. By creating one unifying 'front-end' system--without
  forcing burdensome workflows changes on individual departments--we found it
  much easier to re-use existing content, quickly link new content, and
  cross-link content in more places.


  Of course on paper this can all sound a bit Zany, but the concept itself is
  pretty simple. I will create a sandbox copy of the software so that
  participants can explore the Administrator interface of i-Scout. Although the
  software itself is not the main focus, I think having some hands-on tech will
  help stimulate the discussion.
engagement: >-
  The TeachMeet Session Format would probably work best (although I am open to
  suggestions). This will allow us to briefly discuss a wide range of ideas and
  potential solutions. Participants are encouraged to bring a smartphone, tablet
  or laptop with them, and any examples or questions they may have about
  emerging web technology. I will also bring some hands-on gadgets such as the
  mini-4K touchscreen.
additional_comments: >-
  We are very flexible in terms of what the committee suggests. I can probably
  find another presenter or two here at the Center who would help, but due to
  the transition of leadership right now it's not a good time to get a firm
  commitment. Any suggestions for other speakers or a moderator are welcome.

theme_relationship: >-
  In two ways: The first goal of this project is to engage content ambassadors,
  gatekeepers, and producers into a discussion about how a 'system of systems'
  could be used within a single organization and even across multiple
  organizations. Second, to engage visitors (both physical and virtual) across
  multiple channels using a single platform.
