description: 'Engaging new Americans and refugees has become a recent focus of museums, especially in communities that officially provide refuge. Museums have come up with creative and diverse ways to engage this audience and to demonstrate their philosophical openness to refugees and new Americans through exhibitions, educational programs, and special memberships. This session will provide the opportunity to share examples, knowledge and experiences and brainstorm possibilities as our field develops best practices.'
uniqueness: 'Migration is not a new phenomenon, however the influx of re-settlement and recent world events have resulted in the establishment of certain communities as centers and safe havens for refugees, and museums are responding to this relatively new development by engaging in creative and unique ways.'
objectives: '1. To provide examples of museums’ efforts to welcome and engage new Americans and refugees, including what has worked, what has not.
2. To create a forum for brainstorming ways for museums to effectively and meaningfully engage new Americans and refugees.'
engagement: 'Standard, single session format beginning with introspective questions, small-group brainstorming, sharing, discussion and question/answer.'
additional_comments: 'I am open to suggestions for presenters on this topic from WMA museums with model examples. I am willing to merge with another session. I have a list of possible presenters below and welcome ideas and suggestions.'
other_comments: 'Other possible presenters: 1. Jenni Martin
Director of Education & Programs
Children’s Discovery Museum of San Jose

Children’s Discovery Museum of San Jose, California has a program for immigrant families centered on the shared ingredients in their common food dishes. Jacques Lavergne or Helen Delacretaz
2. Vice President, Visitor Experience and Engagement Director, Exhibitions
Canadian Museum of Human Rights Canadian Museum of Human Rights. This museum recently displayed an exhibition entitled Seeking Refuge that brings together the experiences and perspectives of two teenage boys, one a refugee and the other a young artist who felt compelled to act in response to the refugee crisis. According to their website, more than 65 million people are currently displaced by conflict or persecution. This project contributed to reflection and dialogue about the refugee crisis. This installation is particularly interesting because it stems from, and invites, youth engagement.'
theme_relationship: 'This session is directly tied to the theme of Engage by 1) engaging the new audience of new Americans and refugees, and 2) engaging with the world changes and a philosophical commitment to global inclusion in our new and diverse society. This topic is high on the political agenda on both sides and museums can bridge this gap through their engagement efforts, creating a moment when museums can again highlight their value to society.'

  reason: 'Boise is an official refugee community, and BAM has made some progress through partnerships with the city and the Agency for New Americans to engage new Americans and refugees, including a program that provides transportation, language interpretation and integration in our community Family Art Saturday program, and we would like to do more. This is an opportunity to share the steps we have taken and to learn from other museums so that we can better engage this growing audience. The refugee crisis is a critical global human rights issue today and one in which we want to engage.'

  reason: 'Tucson has a large refugee population, and Morgan developed a program called Museum as Sanctuary that has given the museum a good understanding of how to work with this diverse population. Given the current international refugee crisis, they believe this type of collaboration is becoming increasingly important in building stronger connections between recently re-settled refugees and their new communities. The program fosters expressive arts healing through hands-on art making, exhibitions of participants’ artwork, and alternative label writing by participants for Permanent Collection objects.'

  reason: 'This Las Vegas children’s museum mounted an exhibit, “Torn from Home: My Life as a Refugee,” to offer children and other visitors a hands-on learning experience into the lives of young refugees and their families. It was developed with the help of leading international aid organizations, including the UN refugee agency, the World Food Programme, and Save the Children. The exhibition and education components included items found in camps, recorded stories by refugee children and interactive activities related to human rights. This project must have fostered engagement with the refugee and new American population as well as the general public.'
