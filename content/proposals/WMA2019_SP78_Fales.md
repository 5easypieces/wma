description: >-
  Engaging new Americans and refugees has become a recent focus of museums,
  especially in communities that officially provide refuge. Museums have come up
  with creative and diverse ways to engage this audience and to demonstrate
  their philosophical openness to refugees and new Americans through
  exhibitions, educational programs, and special memberships. This session will
  provide the opportunity to share examples, knowledge and experiences and
  brainstorm possibilities as our field develops best practices.
uniqueness: >-
  Migration is not a new phenomenon, however the influx of re-settlement and
  recent world events have resulted in the establishment of certain communities
  as centers and safe havens for refugees, and museums are responding to this
  relatively new development by engaging in creative and unique ways.
objectives: >-
  1. To provide examples of museums’ efforts to welcome and engage new Americans
  and refugees, including what has worked, what has not.

  2. To create a forum for brainstorming ways for museums to effectively and
  meaningfully engage new Americans and refugees.
engagement: >-
  Standard, single session format beginning with introspective questions,
  small-group brainstorming, sharing, discussion and question/answer.
additional_comments: >-
  I am open to suggestions for presenters on this topic from WMA museums with
  model examples. I am willing to merge with another session. I have a list of
  possible presenters below and welcome ideas and suggestions.

  Other possible presenters: 


  * Jenni Martin Director of Education & Programs Children’s Discovery Museum of
  San Jose 408-298-5437 directorofeducation@cdm.org Children’s Discovery Museum
  of San Jose, California has a program for immigrant families centered on the
  shared ingredients in their common food dishes.

  * Jacques Lavergne or Helen Delacretaz Vice President, Visitor Experience and
  Engagement Director, Exhibitions Canadian Museum of Human Rights. This museum
  recently displayed an exhibition entitled Seeking Refuge that brings together
  the experiences and perspectives of two teenage boys, one a refugee and the
  other a young artist who felt compelled to act in response to the refugee
  crisis. According to their website, more than 65 million people are currently
  displaced by conflict or persecution. This project contributed to reflection
  and dialogue about the refugee crisis. This installation is particularly
  interesting because it stems from, and invites, youth engagement.
theme_relationship: >-
  This session is directly tied to the theme of Engage by:


  1. engaging the new audience of new Americans and refugees, and

  2. engaging with the world changes and a philosophical commitment to global
  inclusion in our new and diverse society. This topic is high on the political
  agenda on both sides and museums can bridge this gap through their engagement
  efforts, creating a moment when museums can again highlight their value to
  society.

    Boise is an official refugee community, and BAM has made some progress
    through partnerships with the city and the Agency for New Americans to
    engage new Americans and refugees, including a program that provides
    transportation, language interpretation and integration in our community
    Family Art Saturday program, and we would like to do more. This is an
    opportunity to share the steps we have taken and to learn from other museums
    so that we can better engage this growing audience. The refugee crisis is a
    critical global human rights issue today and one in which we want to engage.

    Tucson has a large refugee population, and Morgan developed a program called
    Museum as Sanctuary that has given the museum a good understanding of how to
    work with this diverse population. Given the current international refugee
    crisis, they believe this type of collaboration is becoming increasingly
    important in building stronger connections between recently re-settled
    refugees and their new communities. The program fosters expressive arts
    healing through hands-on art making, exhibitions of participants’ artwork,
    and alternative label writing by participants for Permanent Collection
    objects.

    Reno is an official refugee community. The museum has curated exhibitions
    with artwork addressing this topic. They have undoubtedly implemented other
    initiatives relevant to engaging refugees.

    This Las Vegas children’s museum mounted an exhibit, “Torn from Home: My
    Life as a Refugee,” to offer children and other visitors a hands-on learning
    experience into the lives of young refugees and their families. It was
    developed with the help of leading international aid organizations,
    including the UN refugee agency, the World Food Programme, and Save the
    Children. The exhibition and education components included items found in
    camps, recorded stories by refugee children and interactive activities
    related to human rights. This project must have fostered engagement with the
    refugee and new American population as well as the general public.
