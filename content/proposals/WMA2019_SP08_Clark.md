  Everyone learns from their museum visit, but exactly what and how they learn
  differ and are tied to variables such as prior knowledge of the content. In
  this session, we want to share the results of a research study on school
  groups’ learning and memory, show different ways to cater learning experiences
  for different audiences (ex: homeschool groups), and facilitate a
  brainstorming session for how you can further engage visitors with your
  exhibits.
uniqueness: >-
  Research I completed reveals a correlation between learning outcomes and level
  of prior knowledge. (Spoiler: little/no prior knowledge yields more affective
  learning outcomes)
objectives: >-
  * Understand the different ways students will respond to, learn from, and
  engage with your exhibits, depending on variables such as prior knowledge,
  level of interest, presence of educational supplements.

  * See examples of how to engage with educators before, during, and after their
  visit to ensure everyone’s educational needs are met, and feedback museums can
  use for the future.

  * Facilitate useful brainstorming and sharing for attendees to think about how
  they can refine, modify, or engage in new practices to engage their audiences.
engagement: >-
  Ideally, we would have a panel of three presenters briefly share their
  research/strategy/case study then provide some time for a Q&A about those
  presentations. After those specific illustrations, we’d like to then
  facilitate a small-group conversation among the participants with a series of
  questions. Wrapping our session to a close, some can share takeaways or make a
  commitment to at least one small step they can take back to their institution.

  We would like to have one more presenter, and are open to your suggestions. We
  are also willing to merge with another session, if you see a good fit for us!

  Engagement is the backbone of our session. It’s about authentically engaging
  with visitors to understand why they are coming and what they hope to get out
  of their visit. Knowing that, catering programming, educational supplements,
  etc. to align with their motivations and interests to ensure their engagement
  during the museum visit. Ultimately, it’s about how to ensure your offerings
  engage visitors of all types—regardless of why they’re there or who they’re
  there with.

    As part of her master’s program in Museum Studies, Kristine completed
    hands-on research of students’ memory and learning from museum fieldtrips
    during an internship at the Arizona Science Center. Prior to pursuing this
    master’s, she spent 10 years as an educator at the high school level. She
    was a Wanda Chin Fellow and served as a panelist in a session at WMA’s
    conference in Tacoma. Eager to share the results of this research, Kristine
    is the one who initiated contact with the other speaker to potentially
    present at WMA Boise.
