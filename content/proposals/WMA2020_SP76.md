Participants will be presented with possibilities such as forming a Green Team, recycling programs, resource sharing with other organizations, reducing printed paper, switching out lightbulbs, reducing carbon footprints from travel and commuting, designing sustainable display furniture, consolidating shipments, and researching the companies we use.

Another objective is to provide inspiration and ideas for larger projects, such as adjusting internal climate control levels or making building renovations, both of which can significantly reduce energy use. Utilizing consultants and taking advantage of possible rebates for these kind of projects will be included in this discussion.

Museums also have the unique ability to educate the public about climate change and mitigation efforts through our publicly declared green policies and commitments, our exhibitions, and our educational programming. This session aims to instill this type of thinking into our museum mindsets so that sustainability will be a factor in all decision-making.
