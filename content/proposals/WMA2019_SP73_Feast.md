  Advisory committees can provide valuable input and connections to new
  audiences, partnerships, and creative collaborations. This session presents
  practical advice for effectively utilizing community advisory committees for
  both single projects and on-going advancement of the institutional mission.
  From selecting diverse individuals to encouraging sustained participation,
  panelists will share the nuts and bolts of forming, engaging, and maintaining
  a healthy and helpful advisory group.
uniqueness: >-
  Many museums already utilize advisory committees, but this panel will focus on
  ways in which those groups can be reimagined to support more creative
  leadership practices.
objectives: >-
  The objectives of this panel are to:


  1. acknowledge the importance of advisory committees in effectively engaging
  with our communities, 

  2. provide practical steps for forming and utilizing an advisory group, and

  3. share specific engagement strategies that support both short- and long-term
  goals and make a significant impact on the institution’s connection to the
  community. 


  Panelists will also discuss ways in which their institutions create
  accountability and participation with volunteer advisory members.
engagement: >-
  This is a single session panel comprised of three panelists with different
  approaches to community advisory groups. Panelists with present what motivated
  the initial development of the community advisory committee, the steps taken
  to recruit/invite members, the requirements of participation on the committee,
  and examples of the benefits and/or challenges of the group. Panelists and
  session attendees will then divide into groups and discuss specific, practical
  questions in a small-group format.
additional_comments: >-
  My experience with advisory committees is limited to single project groups. I
  would appreciate help in finding three presenters to represent a different
  types of advisory groups – newly formed, on-going, and/or restructured. I also
  plan to invite a member of a past advisory group. I am open to this panel
  being merged with another.

  Engaging community members in conversations about the goals of a project or
  the institutional mission is essential to staying relevant and increasing the
  reach of the organization. In addition, museum professionals can reflect on
  the information shared in these advisory sessions about issues affecting the
  community and the community’s perception of the role the institution plays in
  addressing those needs.

    As the Curator of Education, I am responsible for helping organize advisory
    committees at the Boise Art Museum. We currently utilize advisory groups for
    single projects/exhibitions. I am interested in hearing from colleagues who
    work with advisory committees in other ways and would moderate the panel and
    small-group discussions.
