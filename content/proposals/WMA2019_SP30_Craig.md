  Leading change--whether it's a new space, initiative, or even a mindset--can
  evoke excitement, resistance, or even fear. Whether you've come to WMA with
  changes in mind, or you're leaving with new ideas to implement when you get
  home, you'll benefit from this discussion on how to engage a team through
  careful listening and observation. And, you'll get to talk with some of the
  most successful museum change leaders inspiring enthusiasm and cooperation.
uniqueness: >-
  The session will be innovative because we will investigate the influence of
  human resources - a topic not often provided at WMA.
objectives: >-
  After attending this session participants will: 


  1. Be introduced to established leadership and organizational models and be
  able to connect with at least one for further investigation: Bolman and Deal's
  **Four Frames** from the classic leadership text **Reframing Organizations**,
  first published 25 years ago and now in its 6th edition.  Influencer model and
  the sources of influence from **Influencer: The New Science of Leading
  Change**, 2013.  **Creating Magic**,  Others or substitutes to be determined
  with further consultation with the panel and recommendations from WMA

  2. Be inspired to take time and care in how changes are proposed and
  implemented at their museums _ Instead of complaining about
  board/staff/director/volunteers -- use strategies to sew positive thinking and
  resolve potential concerns before they arise. _ Participants will have
  awareness of resources available to them to outline plans for introducing
  change; possibly take time to draft some of their ideas during the session

  3. Have the opportunity to interact with one another and some of the best
  leaders in the field _ participants will have the opportunity to interact with
  leading directors who they may not otherwise have access to _ participants
  will connect with one another and have the opportunity to stay connected after
  the session through a list-serv or simple email exchange

  4. Outcomes: _ Develop an online community (through email exchange or a
  list-serv) focused on engaging museum teams through attentive listening and
  observation (in lieu of complaining about those who aren't 'on board') _
  Increase competence among WMA professionals in human resources and management

  Museums are always considering how to better engage audiences, but we often
  forget about leading that engagement from home base--our volunteers, staff,
  and leadership. These internal groups are our 'allies'--looking to fulfill a
  common mission. Anyone--not just directors--can engage a team toward
  cooperation and success in new initiatives.
