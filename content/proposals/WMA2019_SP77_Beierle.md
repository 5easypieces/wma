description: 'This session will focus on fostering different kinds of community and inter-agency partnerships to engage existing audiences and cultivate new ones. Additionally, panelists will discuss the process of developing and retaining partner relationships of all kinds. Relationship building can be tough, but it is also an integral part of lasting partnerships. Learn how different background and different missions can come together for mutually beneficial outcomes!'

One panelist will describe a 
2.        Demonstrate how to anticipate and plan for hiccups and roadblocks.
3.        Outline how to make the partnership last.
'
engagement: 'This would be a standard session with panelists discussing their partnerships. Since each deals with a different kind of relationship we would do a breakout time. Asking the audience to choose which partnership (relationship) they want to “commit” too. They would then ask questions, outline, strategize with that panelist in particular. The idea being those like-minded directions can learn and grow with each other to maximize their museums potential.'
additional_comments: 'This could easily be a stand-alone session or merged with a similar session(s). If merged there might be a need to pare down committed panelists. Always open to making it the strongest session possible'
other_comments: 'An essential part of lasting partnerships is understanding they can form anywhere with anyone.'
theme_relationship: 'The session is all about museums engaging with our community to benefit common and/or newly developed missions and purposes. Relationship building within these partnerships requires a commitment to the each other and engaging each other for a shared good. '
