additional_comments: "For now, this session has only two presenters, the co-curators for __Albert Bierstadt: Witness to a Changing West__ from the Buffalo Bill Center of the West and Gilcrease Museum. We absolutely would like to add presenters and perhaps explore one or two additional museum exhibition partnership case studies. We?d be happy to merge with another session if you find a good fit. Thank you to the Program Committee for considering our proposal!"

description: "'Our museum is way overstaffed!' said no museum professional ever. Many museums operate with a tight budget and lean staff relative to their size. With limited resources, how can cultural institutions produce meaningful exhibitions on a large scale? Museum partnerships offer an opportunities to create more robust, impactful exhibitions than a single institution can achieve alone. This session explores a recent exhibition partnership, offers lessons learned, and invites participants to brainstorm a future partnership opportunity for their museum."
engagement: "First, presenters will briefly present case studies and lessons learned from recent museum exhibition partnerships (30-40 mins). Second, attendees will be invited to break into groups of 3-4 people to discuss their ideas for museum exhibition partnerships (10 mins). Third, attendees will have a chance to share insights from their group discussions and engage in a dialogue with presenters about museum partnership projects (25 mins)."
objectives: "Why form a museum partnership in the first place? Presenters will discuss some of the potential benefits of creating an exhibition through a partnership between two or more museums: sharing collections, sharing staff knowledge, increasing overall staff capacity, increasing creative potential, securing venues for a traveling exhibition, among others. By exploring proven examples of a museum exhibition partnership, this session will provide participants with templates for initiating and sustaining museum partnerships through complex projects. This session will describe the initial exhibition idea, partner contracts and budgets, content brainstorming, interpretation, and marketing and the regular communication required to meet project targets on schedule. By using the exhibition __Albert Bierstadt: Witness to a Changing West__ as a case study, this session will also describe both successes and possible pitfalls of planning an exhibition between two institutions. * Ultimately, this session will demonstrate one of many benefits of traveling and getting to know museum colleagues! Building relationships through personal interactions at museum conferences, symposia, and other events helps set up museum partnerships for success.  In addition to hearing from presenters, this session will invite attendees to take about 5-10 minutes in small groups to discuss their ideas, large and small, for a potential exhibition partnership."

  reason: "Karen McWhorter and Laura Fry worked with Peter Hassrick as three co-curators for the exhibition __Albert Bierstadt: Witness to a Changing West.__ This exhibition was produced through a partnership between Gilcrease Museum and the Buffalo Bill Center of the West. Karen and Laura teamed up to produce the exhibition title, press release, exhibition text, video content for the exhibition, and two essays for the catalogue.  Without a clear partnership model from other institutions, they established a new process for managing the project. Together they hope to share their experiences?including successes, potential pitfalls, and lessons learned."
