  Join a discussion of the successes and challenges of working with university
  students who engage with the University of Arizona Museum of Art through their
  courses. Learn about approaches that allow students to make connections
  through dialogue, art-making, and object-based learning plus examples of
  strategies, tours, and projects for single-class visits and semester-long
  courses. How might we make art museum experiences inspirational and accessible
  for the diverse community of learners on college campuses?
uniqueness: >-
  We will focus on engaging diverse student populations and offer interactive
  techniques for working with university students visiting art museums as part
  of classes.
objectives: >-
  Many university students are first-time museum visitors and represent a huge
  range of personal backgrounds, learning styles, and academic and career
  interests. This session will consider how museums can best work with the
  diverse range of university students who visit the museum through courses and
  class visits, including art and non-art subject areas. We will explore how
  museum staff and faculty can pave the way for students to make new connections
  to the content in their courses, consider personal connections to works of
  art, share and build ideas and interpretations together through dialogue, and
  make the museum an active learning environment. Examples will range from a
  semester-long museum education course that met and led tours in the museum to
  materials developed to engage students as they explore the museum on their own
  or with peers. 


  Outcomes: 


  1. Participants will leave with specific ideas on ways they may engage
  university students at the museum through university courses and campus
  connections.

  2. Participants will have the opportunity to learn from each other through a
  discussion on how to engage university students in the museum.

  3. Participants will consider how they can reach a diverse range of students
  in the museum through dialogic techniques, hands-on activities, and other
  forms of engagement with works of art.
engagement: >-
  Participants will first learn about some of the programs, courses, and other
  ways in which university students engage with art and each other in the museum
  and then experience some of the gallery activities described in this session.
  They will also have the opportunity to discuss their own successes and
  challenges in working with university students and share ideas with each
  other.
additional_comments: >-
  We are open to merging with another session, especially ones related to
  university museums.
