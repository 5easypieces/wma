  Museums across the country are breaking down silos between the sciences, arts,
  and humanities to create interdisciplinary experiences that help visitors
  understand our complex world. This session’s project team - consisting of an
  art museum, a living history museum, and a science center - has been taking
  these efforts one step further by connecting with content experts from outside
  our museums’ core disciplines and highlighting them at interdisciplinary
  public programs. These artists, scientists, and historians illuminate the real
  work they do, humanize their professions, and help make connections between
  seemingly disparate fields
uniqueness: >-
  This interactive lecture will include staff from types of museums and will
  include hands-on and minds-on activities for participants to take back to
  their sites.
objectives: >-
  1. Delineate different ways to recruit cross-disciplinary content experts
  within their own community.

  2. Execute two communication training activities designed to prepare content
  experts to share their work with visitors in a museum environment.

  3. Identify public program opportunities at their own institutions that can be
  enhanced by cross-disciplinary content experts.
engagement: >-
  This interactive lecture will be divided into three parts that will include
  hands-on and minds-on activities: After an introduction to the project,
  participants will share and brainstorm at table-groups strategies for
  identifying and recruiting cross-disciplinary content experts from their
  community. Presenters will facilitate two sample communication training
  activities designed to prepare content experts to share their work with museum
  visitors. Presenters will introduce a flexible framework that participants can
  adapt to support interdisciplinary programming at their own institutions.
