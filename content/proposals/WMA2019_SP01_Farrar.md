description: 'Museums across the country are breaking down silos between the sciences, arts, and humanities to create interdisciplinary experiences that help visitors understand our complex world. This session’s project team - consisting of an art museum, a living history museum, and a science center - has been taking these efforts one step further by connecting with content experts from outside our museums’ core disciplines and highlighting them at interdisciplinary public programs. These artists, scientists, and historians illuminate the real work they do, humanize their professions, and help make connections between seemingly disparate fields'
uniqueness: 'This interactive lecture will include staff from types of museums and will include hands-on and minds-on activities for participants to take back to their sites.'
objectives: '1. Delineate different ways to recruit cross-disciplinary content experts within their own community.
2. Execute two communication training activities designed to prepare content experts to share their work with visitors in a museum environment.
3. Identify public program opportunities at their own institutions that can be enhanced by cross-disciplinary content experts.'
engagement: 'This interactive lecture will be divided into three parts that will include hands-on and minds-on activities: After an introduction to the project, participants will share and brainstorm at table-groups strategies for identifying and recruiting cross-disciplinary content experts from their community. Presenters will facilitate two sample communication training activities designed to prepare content experts to share their work with museum visitors. Presenters will introduce a flexible framework that participants can adapt to support interdisciplinary programming at their own institutions.'
