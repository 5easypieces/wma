session_objectives = """The session aims to accomplish the following objectives:  1) Demonstrate the sense of responsibility that Indigenous museum practitioners feel when they care for their own ancestral belongings. Over the years, we have heard numerous stories from our Indigenous colleagues about their reasons for working within museums. Often, their choice is wrapped up in familial/tribal obligations that make their work more than just a career choice. In this panel, we want to draw out the intense sense of responsibility that Indigenous museum practitioners feel to caring for ancestral belongings in museums.  2) Encourage participants to develop letter-writing workshops in their home institutions in order to foster healthier institutional work environments. Although our session features Indigenous museum practitioners, letter-writing is something everyone within the museum profession can do. Therefore, this session models a creative way in which museums can provide exercises for their staff to learn from each other’s experiences to develop cross-cultural empathy and respect.  """
