description: 'Museums are often tasked with presenting contemporary art installations that don?t fit the mold of our traditional policies and procedures. How can we engage with contemporary artists without misunderstandings, conflicts, or frustrations so that we can fully present their visions while still adhering to best practices for risk management, ethics and registration methods'
uniqueness: 'This will be an opportunity for museum staff to discuss problems, usually not shared beyond their own museum''s walls, in an open forum for input.'
objectives: 'Examples will be presented of installations that were difficult to manage, either due to non-traditional materials, the risky manner in which they were presented, or tense relationships that emerged with the artists or their representatives. Perspectives of both registrars and curators will be included.  By frankly discussing problems encountered, mistakes made and solutions found, this session aims to foster an open discussion, including the audience, to increase our collective awareness of procedures and policies that need to be established or updated in our institutions.  Issues will include: * Installation materials (e.g. live plants, mold, dirt, strong scents, sharp objects) that are potentially risky to visitors or the museum''s internal environment. * Division of museum staff responsibilities for the daily maintenance of A/V materials, and/or emergency cleanup responses for installations that are inherently messy. * Insurance valuations which can be a source of conflict between museums and galleries. * Dilemmas of how to track and describe works, such as performances, time-based media, or immersive environments, which don?t fit the traditional definition of loan objects or the fields provided by our collection databases. * Policies for fairly sharing the burden and costs with artists and/or galleries for the repair or cleaning of components which are intended for interaction with visitors. * Policies for keeping or dispersing components, provided and paid for by the host museum, after the exhibition closes. * Ethics of when to consider an artwork as ''commissioned'' by the host museum and what happens to it after the exhibition closes.'
engagement: 'There will be 3 presenters; one presenter will also act as moderator.  Each will have 15 minutes to present an illustrated examples of difficult art installations they have experienced.  The moderator will then pose questions to the presenters as well as to the audience in order to foster discussion (approx. 30 minutes) of the issues raised, and to hear about other museums'' issues, problems and solutions found when exhibiting contemporary art.'
additional_comments: 'For now, one presenter will also act as moderator, however a separate moderator could be added if needed. '
other_comments: 'Mainly intended for art museum professionals but may be useful and/or interesting to staff of other types of museums.'
theme_relationship: 'In order to modernize our exhibition policies and procedures to be truly current, we must engage all involved staff so that all voices and concerns are heard and addressed.  With clear best practices established, we can then engage in a professional, consistent and timely fashion with artists and their representatives so that relationships remain smooth, artworks are presented at their best, risks to the public and the museum are minimized, and staff can maintain their sanity!'

  is_confirmed: TRUE
  is_presenting: TRUE
  reason: Cory is a registrar with 30 years of experience in art museums and collections. These museums have ranged from large with big budgets (LACMA, Getty), to small with modest staff numbers and budgets.  She learned registration procedures from the Museum Registration Methods and through experience, not school.  Each of the contemporary art exhibitions she has worked on have presented new and different challenges which are typically not covered in the ?Registrar?s Bible?. She is eager to foster frank discussions within the museum world and hopes to contribute to developing best practices in this area.

  is_confirmed: TRUE
  reason: For the last eight years that Cory has been working on contemporary art exhibitions, she has worked with a wide variety of solo and group artists, some new to museum shows and others experienced and rising in the art world. Some artists or galleries have been difficult for museum staff to deal with. Installations have included live leeches, large pools of water in darkened galleries, and bark dust covering gallery floors, to name just a few. Some installations in retrospect should never have been approved, but there were no existing policies in place to justify denying the artist?s wishes.

  title: Registrar

  primary_email: AndrewW@bellevuearts.org

  telephone: 425-519-0761
  is_confirmed: TRUE
  reason: Andrew is an emerging professional registrar working at an art museum that has a small staff but puts on ambitious exhibitions, including ones with complicated materials or artists who come from the gallery world. He received his training via a museum studies graduate program and various museum internships, so he brings a different perspective to some of the same issues that an ?old school? registrar -such as Cory Gooch- encounters. Also, BAM is a non-collecting museum, which is a slightly different situation than the museums of the other speakers.  
presenter_3:
  first_name: Nicole
  last_name: Herden
  title: Curator of Art
  organization: Boise Art Museum
  city:
  primary_email: nicole@boiseartmuseum.org
  secondary_email:
  telephone: 208-345-8330 x19
  is_confirmed: TRUE
  reason: The Boise Art Museum has featured many exhibitions of contemporary art, and Nicole has been their curator for the last three years; she also has held curatorial positions at the Phoenix Art Museum and Arizona State University Art Museum.  Prior to her current appointment in Boise, she was the registrar for the same museum, so she can bring to the discussion a perspective of both registrar and curator.
