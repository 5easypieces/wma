description: 'Transgender people are members of every community museums engage, from staff and volunteers to visitors and participants. How can your institution create a safe space for people of all genders? This panel discussion will include a brief overview of gender identity and transgender topics before diving in to a conversation about successful engagement around the region. Learn from your colleagues and develop strategies to take home with you.'
uniqueness: 'None of WMA 2018’s sessions addressed LGBTQ issues. Museums must consider how they engage this segment of the population at all levels of operations.'
objectives: 'Objectives:
Participants will increase understanding of gender identity and the needs of transgender people in museums.
Participants will consider strategies for their museums to create more welcoming spaces for transgender people.
Outcomes:
Participants will use provided language and resources to develop effective transgender-inclusive policies and practices at their own organizations.'
engagement: 'Roundtable conversation
After a brief overview of gender identity, the moderator and panelists will join participants in a circle to discuss topics related to transgender people in museums: transgender museum professionals, welcoming trans participants, and developing infrastructure to be more welcoming of transgender people.
This format decreases the perception of “experts” in the topic, drawing all participants in to engage with the topic as equals and look for shared solutions to problems.'
