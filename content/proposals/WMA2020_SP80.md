     a.	Using language to aid in community building verse detracting from it?
      i.	Inspired by practices of Nonviolent Communication; a process developed by Marshall Rosenberg for supporting partnership and resolving conflict, we will explore how to use words to encourage community as opposed to detracting from it.
             1.	Some specific examples are; using terms that communicate requests verses expectations such as “Are you willing to___?” Verse “Will you___? “or “Can you___?”
2.	Introductions and inclusion.
     a.	Does the president of your board and/or your executive director know your volunteers?
     b.	Do all staff members know who is part of their own community?
     c.	Are introductions always being made, at every level, with everyone, when opportunity arises?
             i.	Everyone is of equal importance; this is one small way to lead by example to showcase that fact.
3.	There is a place for everyone.
     a.	As a staff member we are support staff to our volunteers, not the other way around.
     b.	If someone wants to be involved in your community it is your job to find out how to best support them in having a meaningful volunteer experience.
     c.	What communities are being ignored in your volunteer pool?
             i.	At our institution we have strong partnerships with community organizations that support people with different developmental abilities and skillsets, as well as groups that help those over 55 and those needing to build job skills for other various reasons.
            ii.	How can we invite everyone into our organization as equal team members?

Resources needed; Chairs, projector, and open minds.

How can we create a community of care and inclusion within the museum space? As museums continue to be understaffed and underfunded, museum volunteers become the backbone of many institutions and the link to our greater community at large. This session will explore community building inside our institutions, particularly how to find, recruit, engage and sustain a committed volunteer community that is not separate from staff or board but in a position of equality.
