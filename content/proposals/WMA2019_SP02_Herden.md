description: 'Visitors bring objects to life through a personal, compelling narrative. How then, do museums facilitate this journey and introduce them to new objects and perspectives? This session will examine innovative exhibition design and programmatic approaches through three case studies. Presenters will discuss strategic partnerships and methods, and even consider projects that have been oversaturated with this paradigm. Critical considerations such as time, resources, and ensuring authenticity will also be addressed.'
uniqueness: 'This session highlights specific case studies of museums that utilized practices of storytelling.'
objectives: '1. To show a variety of storytelling methods in exhibition and/or programming
2. To brainstorm additional ways of storytelling
3. Explore how these approaches can be used in a variety of museums'
engagement: 'This will be a single session format that includes 3 micro-PowerPoint presentations highlighting unique, innovative approaches to implementing storytelling throughout the exhibition design phase. Following each presentation, each presenter will remark on one of the following topics:
* strategic partnerships (voiceovers, scripts, writers, etc.)
* when this approach is overused
* when it is appropriate – consider resources / time / authenticity'
additional_comments: 'I would like help finding presenters. I am especially interested in highlighting three unique approaches from distinct institutions, such as: historical museum, musical museum, and an art museum.'
other_comments: ''
theme_relationship: 'This session directly relates to the 2019 theme of ENGAGE by examining how museums have used innovative methods of storytelling to engage new audiences.'

other_suggestions: 'Is there an easy way of getting feedback for our 2018 session – even if informally? What went well? What could be improved, etc. We received lots of positive comments about our session, but that feedback was limited to folks we spoke to in person (& they were too kind to say bad things to us J). Thanks!'
