  Visitors bring objects to life through a personal, compelling narrative. How
  then, do museums facilitate this journey and introduce them to new objects and
  perspectives? This session will examine innovative exhibition design and
  programmatic approaches through three case studies. Presenters will discuss
  strategic partnerships and methods, and even consider projects that have been
  oversaturated with this paradigm. Critical considerations such as time,
  resources, and ensuring authenticity will also be addressed.

  historical museum, musical museum, and an art museum.

    As a museum professional who has successfully utilized this paradigm in an
    art exhibition, I believe there are more approaches and considerations that
    are worth investigating and sharing with my colleagues.

    Collection. This case study will highlight artwork selections, thematic
    curation, and innovative community partnership and engagement.

  Is there an easy way of getting feedback for our 2018 session – even if
  informally? What went well? What could be improved, etc. We received lots of
  positive comments about our session, but that feedback was limited to folks we
  spoke to in person (& they were too kind to say bad things to us J). Thanks!
