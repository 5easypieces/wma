description: "This session will discuss the changing roles of curators and tribal members in creating impactful and decolonized exhibits/programming."
uniqueness: "The session will be unique in that it will be presented by two non-native voices and two native American leaders who work closely with tribal members and facilitate their representation in museum spaces."
objectives: "The objective of this session will be to provide one or two possible options for other museums who are struggling to get minority voices in their exhibits and programming."
engagement: "The format will be a PowerPoint presentation from the non-native presenters, and one from the native presenters. This way the audiences gets two perspectives on the same issues. "
additional_comments: "I am willing to merge with another session."
other_comments: ""
theme_relationship: "This session relates to the theme of ENGAGE because our priority is to engage minority groups, especially tribal members, in telling their own stories in their own voices. Not only does the exhibit engage the co-curators, but subsequently will engage the audience because of the first person narratives. "
