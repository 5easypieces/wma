description: 'This session is an exploration of mindfulness and its impact on both museum staff and the opportunities for mindfulness in public programming. Quieting the mind, letting go of mental clutter, regaining focus all open the door to seeing and experiencing museums in new ways. Panelists will share ideas about self-reflection, organizational culture change/growth, and replicable examples of mindfulness-centered programs for museum audiences and museum staff.'
uniqueness: 'This session focuses on encouraging self-reflective practices that reinforce the intentionality of the important work museum professionals do.'
objectives: '1. To present opportunities for the utilization of mindfulness exercises at the individual, museum staff level.
2. To discuss a variety of ways in which museums do engage, or could engage museum visitors through mindfulness-centered programs.'
engagement: 'Standard, single session, with time for questions. After an introduction to the concept of and theory behind mindfulness, and a guided mindfulness exercise, we will discuss how it can apply more broadly to the museum environment. Further examples of mindfulness in museum practices and programs will follow, from one or more additional panelists. The takeaways are a mindfulness exercise and the opportunity to introduce mindfulness in a variety of ways in museum environments.'
additional_comments: 'We would like help finding presenters. We are especially interested in involving museum educators or program developers whose institutions are already offering mindfulness exercises for their staff and/or visitors. HR directors and individuals responsible for staff development/team building could also contribute to the conversation. We are willing to merge with another session.'

theme_relationship: 'The session related to the 2019 theme of ENGAGE is that it will focus on the ways museums engage with their communities and staff. The fostering of mindfulness has the potential to contribute to positive and more engaged work environments, and unconventional partnerships to present educational programs.'

  reason: 'I believe this is an interesting and useful topic to explore. I have taken note of trends in the field, such as guided mindfulness sessions in museums, tai chi in botanical gardens, and morning yoga in sculpture courts, even meditation breaks at the AAM conference. Mindfulness is trending as a tool for calming the mind to focus on the moment. In our digital age full of distractions, museums can serve an important role in teaching visitors how to “unplug” and regain focus'

  reason: 'The Frye Art Museum offers free 30-minute mindfulness meditation sessions, in partnership with a local health care provider. According to their program description, “Present-moment awareness is essential to experience and appreciate any work of art, but it can be elusive and we often find ourselves distracted or lost in thought. Through the training and practice of mindfulness meditation we can apply present-moment awareness not only to experience art, but to all aspects of life. We can discover a calm amidst our to-do lists and more fully appreciate the gift of each day.”'
