description: "There is increasing awareness of the need for museums to share the stories of people of all backgrounds. How do we tell the stories of people of color, differing religious backgrounds, ethnicities and orientations' How do we tell these stories in the context of controversy, crime or social justice? This session will uncover how to make institutions more inclusive through thoughtful interpretation."
uniqueness: "Museums must navigate through difficult topics in order to become inclusive in an era where social justice is increasingly relevant."
objectives: "1. Identify opportunities to make your institution more inclusive and what the potential controversies are in sharing those stories thoughtfully.
*2. Discuss how to properly implement interpretive exhibits, programs or events with the help of outside scholars and community engagement.
*3. Discuss methods of audience evaluation after your project is opened or completed. Are museum professionals prepared for honest feedback from visitors?"
engagement: "Because this session is based on experience with interpreting difficult topics, it will be primarily presentation and discussion based, with presenters using PowerPoint and audio-visual elements to reflect on experience with a specific exhibit at the Old Idaho Penitentiary and other issues the panelists have faced at the Idaho Black History Museum and the Minidoka National Historic Site. Audience members will be given questions to discuss with each other and the panelists."
additional_comments: "This could certainly be merged with another session if needed. I would be happy to coordinate with presenters and adjust those needs if necessary."
other_comments: ""
theme_relationship: "This session approaches inclusivity as a way to allow all visitors to become connected with museums on a deeper level. The best way for museums to engage audiences is through relevant storytelling that presents topics in new and thought-provoking ways, and may even reach visitors no previous connection to the institution."
