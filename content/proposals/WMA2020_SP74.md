session_objectives = """Telling stories from a first person perspective has been key at JANM. Engaging with docents about their WWII experience, when many of them were forcibly removed from the West Coast and incarcerated in America’s concentration camps, makes the history personal. As this generation approaches the twilight of their lives, JANM staff has had to fundamentally rethink how to capture these stories and keep them alive for generations to come.

JANM’s strategic direction aims to inspire its visitors to see history through a social justice lens to understand the present and to enliven our democracy. JANM is experimenting with artificial intelligence, virtual reality and other technologies to tell the Japanese American experience differently and to make the artifact collection accessible to a broader audience.

Through collaboration with StoryFile, JANM will debut an experience that will allow visitors to converse with Lawson Sakai, a WWII veteran who fought with the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, a segregated unit in the US military composed of Japanese Americans. JANM and StoryFile content developers generated over 800 questions to ask Lawson throughout a 25-hour interview about his life. JANM visitors will be able to engage with Lawson’s avatar by asking questions. AI technology will scan the 25 hours of content, and “Lawson” will return his answers. Because of this technology, future generations will continue to learn about the heroism and sacrifice of Lawson’s generation.

Session attendees will be able to engage directly with “Lawson” and learn more about this innovative way to engage with historical figures.
