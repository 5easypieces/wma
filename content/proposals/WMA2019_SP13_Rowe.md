  Speed networking is a structured format specifically designed to accelerate
  contacts in timed intervals signaled with a whistle. This event begins with a
  brief overview of very specific instructions on how the program works. Chairs
  are pre-setup across from each other in pairs enabling participants to move
  from chair to chair in a pre-determined sequence whereby information and
  business card exchange will occur. These are fun, fast-paced, timed intervals
  concluding with everyone meeting each other briefly. At the conclusion,
  mingling will continue. Speed Networking has occurred the past three years at
  the WMA conference as a stand-alone, free, event aligned with the opening
  evening festivities.
uniqueness: >-
  There is nothing else like this during the conference. This program provides
  structured one on one introductions in a fun, relaxed, jovial environment.
objectives: >-
  This program provides an efficient, expedient, fun (a WMA core value) data
  exchange event for attendees to kick off the conference. We create a uniquely
  'safe' and fun environment for everyone who enters the space with warm
  welcomes and humor. This works well for all personality types ranging from shy
  to outgoing.


  **POTENTIAL OUTCOMES: **Sitting across from many new faces exchanging cards in
  a humorous, light-hearted format accelerates the ice-breaking process enabling
  deeper networking potential to occur throughout the subsequent days of the
  conference.
engagement: >-
  This is a format that is practiced in other settings including corporate
  conferences. Participants have very clear instructions of where and how to
  start and how to move through the room with every blow of the referee's
  whistle. With clear instructions, participants will have no social obligation
  accept to follow the directions.

theme_relationship: >-
  Face to face engagement will inspire new ideas, new relationships, new
  contacts, and/or new friends. Specific stories of what participants hope to
  achieve in the short and long term and what they need to get there will
  inspire some interesting conversations and potential connections.
