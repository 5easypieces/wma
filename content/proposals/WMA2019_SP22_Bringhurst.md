description: "Museum partnerships with national education programs can bring a host of benefits to your community. This session will focus on a successful partnership between the Idaho State Museum and National History Day.  An NHD student, teacher, parent, and professional along with the NHD coordinators from Utah and Idaho will discuss lessons learned from developing this partnership, the numerous benefits to the community, and ideas for how other states can forge partnerships with education initiatives.  "
uniqueness: "Offering perspectives from a student, teacher, parent and a professional who went through the program, offers a unique lens to learn about community partnerships."
objectives: "1. Show how education partnerships strengthen a community through the eyes of community members.
*2. Offer ideas on how to successfully forge partnerships that will help museums engage with schools.
*3. Identify and offer ways to foster the connection between education partnerships, historical literacy and informed citizenship in communities. 
*4. Because National History Day is a local, state, and national program with many community partners across the country, it is able to be a big driver in helping students really see the relevancy of history."
engagement: "This would be a standard session with panelists each taking turns to offer their perspective on this education partnership using audio/visual presentations. We will conclude with a Q&A session where participants can question the panelists."
additional_comments: "This could be a stand alone session, or merged with another session, but it may be necessary to pare down the number of panelists.  
*I have already identified potential presenters, and have confirmed participation by Wendy Rex Atzet, the Utah National History Day coordinator. Other possible presenters: David Pettyjohn, director of the Idaho Humanities Council and former NHD student, Chris Wilson, professor of Education at BYU-Idaho and proud NHD parent, Janelle Gilson, NHD teacher at Renaissance High school, and Josh White, former NHD student, WWII History Museum Student Ambassador and Normandy Institute student fellow."
other_comments: "Important to note that every person on a museum team is important to making a partnership meaningful."
theme_relationship: "Every museum professional wants to see their community ENGAGE with the museum, and this is a way that museums can ENGAGE with pre-teens, teens, teachers, and parents to foster a mutual connection.
*Education programs are also a way to foster civic ENGAGEMENT, which we have seen in recent years has become so important in the field of the humanities and indeed the survival of our democracy.  "
