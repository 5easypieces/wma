description: >-
  This session will include presentations, a small group activity, and
  discussion to address incorporating high school student engagement on social
  issues, which includes original contributions incorporated onto the floor of
  museum exhibits. Examples of successful programs from the Los Altos History
  Museum and/ or the Oakland Museum of California, and/the Computer History
  Museum will be offered. In the small group activity attendees will design a
  workshop on social issues for high school students and brainstorm on original
  installations students might be able to create.
uniqueness: >-
  Garnering high school student interest and creative projects is a challenging
  and rewarding undertaking, one which requires significant planning, curriculum
  development, and community support. The Los Altos History Museum ran a unique
  and successful program and is eager to share practical tips and allow other
  museum to develop similar programs. The Oakland Museum of California and the
  Computer History Museum also have different types of student engagement
  programs, and this session will be a unique opportunity for comparison.
objectives: >-
  The three main objectives of this single session include:


  1. To inform the audience about Los Altos History Museum’s and Oakland
  Museum’s experiences—the successes and challenges—with engaging teenage youth
  on social issues and incorporating their creative pieces in exhibit
  installations.

  2. To offer concrete examples as models for designing workshop curriculum
  around social issues and for facilitating creative contributions from teenage
  youth.

  3. To hold open discussion on the process of incorporating high school student
  participation and strengths and limits of the outcomes at each museum for
  their respective exhibits.


  Potential outcomes of this single session include that panelists and audience
  members will have an opportunity to assess the approaches and experiences of
  Los Altos History Museum and Oakland Museum in working with teenage youth and
  consider patterns in successful teen engagement.

  Toward this end, the following key questions will be presented to panelists: 


  * What drew in your teenage participants? 

  * Was the social issue(s) related to the exhibit an important factor in
  attracting teen interest? 

  * Were the teen participants mostly interested in the chance to create an
  installation for the exhibit?

  * What other factor(s) played a role in teen engagement? 


  Another outcome of the discussion will be that, in small groups, attendees
  will brainstorm and begin developing a plan to include teen participation in
  an upcoming exhibit. 



  Take homes include handouts of the curriculum reader, list of workshop
  presenters, and daily schedule prepared by LAHM Co-curators and staff as part
  of a workshop for high school students who learned about Juana Briones, her
  time period, social issues related to her life, and created projects for the
  exhibit _Inspired by Juana: La Doña de la Frontera _(October 18, 2018 – March
  31, 2019).

  The session format will begin with slideshow presentations given by the
  participating museums (20 minutes) followed by small group work for attendees
  (30 minutes) and end with discussion and open Q & A (25 minutes). The groups
  will be instructed to select one upcoming exhibit that a small group member is
  involved with to brainstorm around methods of reaching out to high school
  students and specific ways teen participants might contribute to the exhibit.

theme_relationship: >-
  This session is directly related to the theme ENGAGE by addressing the topic
  of engaging high school students in museum exhibits, particularly around
  social issues. Many museums, including especially history museums, struggle
  with defining relevance and in creating genuine engagement of teenagers with
  the museum. This session addresses one of the most difficult audiences with
  which to engage, and offers a successful model of how to meaningfully allow
  teenagers to fully engage with an exhibition topic.
