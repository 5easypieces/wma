  What happens when you bring together a collection of women's shoes, a history
  class about women in the U.S. West filled with students from several
  disciplines, a makerspace, and digital technologies' Maker and curatorial
  magic! Come learn how a partnership among curatorial and registration staff, a
  history professor, a librarian, and an instructional designer increased
  students' understanding of women's history, led them to think of themselves as
  makers, and resulted in interesting interpretations of an overlooked
  collection.
uniqueness: >-
  Because this partnership focused on using historical artifacts to increase
  both students' understanding of the past and their digital savvy, museum staff
  gained both pedagogical and technological insights.
objectives: >-
  By the end of the session, participants will:


  * learn how one high-impact, low-cost case study was organized and assessed.

  * consider how best to structure similar, sustainable projects in their
  institutional contexts in ways that benefit all participants.

  * identify benefits and potential pitfalls in working with students, faculty,
  and others on a university timeline.
engagement: >-
  After we briefly summarize the goals of the collaboration, outline our
  process, and share some student work, we will walk participants through active
  learning and discussion that will help them develop their own productive
  collaborations. We will employ several different brief activities (e.g.,
  carousel, think-pair-square-share, gallery walk, large- or small-group
  discussion) to push participants to think creatively about potentially
  high-impact partnerships.

  If there's another session about museum-university collaborations, and they?re
  dedicated to active learning rather than simply lecture/presentation, we?d be
  open to combining with them, possibly for a longer session, depending on their
  goals.
