2)	Audience recognizes the risks of neglecting workplace culture, and the benefits of creating a Social Committee or something similar.
3)	Audience members feel empowered to push for similar initiatives in their own institution. They learn how to start a social committee, how to gain institutional support, and examples of events and activities to try.
