  Gather round the (artificial) campfire as we swap unimaginable but true tales
  of museum craft, such as:


  * Spine tingling tales about human resources practices! (The HR in HoRRor!)

  * Devilish stories of development (You can take it with you? Unplanned
  giving?)

  * Creepy collections management! (Tales from the Crypt)

  * Astonishing Legends of Early Learning (the infected! Night of the living
  germs!)


  Learn from those who have lived to tell these tales...and share your own if
  you dare!

    There is nothing better than a good old fashioned story swap. It is
    cathartic and inspirational. Seth recognizes the power of this type of
    session and will moderate it so that there is solid mix of topics and tales.
