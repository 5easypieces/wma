description: "Gather round the (artificial) campfire as we swap unimaginable but true tales of museum craft, such as: * Spine tingling tales about human resources practices! (The HR in HoRRor!) * Devilish stories of development (You can take it with you? Unplanned giving?) * Creepy collections management! (Tales from the Crypt) * Astonishing Legends of Early Learning (the infected! Night of the living germs!) * Learn from those who have lived to tell these tales...and share your own if you dare!"
