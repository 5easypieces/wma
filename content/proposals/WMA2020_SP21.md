session_objectives = """Session attendees will hear from the Burke’s Tribal Liaison, Executive Director, and members of the Native American Advisory Board (NAAB), and will learn:

How the need for a Tribal Liaison was identified;

How community voices—primarily via the Native American Advisory Board—shaped this role, helped determine its place within our organizational structure, and guided a discussion of the qualities and types of knowledge the role would require; and

What new efforts the Tribal Liaison has put into place and how this work has served to both further the museum’s EID goals and, beyond that, support its mission to “care for and share natural and cultural collections so all people can learn, be inspired, generate knowledge, feel joy, and heal.”

Attendees will leave this session with an understanding of how the work of a Tribal Liaison has relevance and implications that extend well beyond the curatorial and education departments. At the Burke, our Tribal Liaison also collaborates with staff members in the development, communications, exhibits and visitors experience departments, as well as with our boards and volunteers. These wide-ranging interactions deepen cohesion and collegiality within and among museum departments and stakeholder groups.

The presence of a Tribal Liaison on staff contributes to meaningful systemic change tending toward equity, inclusion and decolonization that will serve every group that comes into contact with the Burke, by promoting an institutional culture that values and reflects the input of a broader range of voices and thus meets the needs of a broader range of audiences.
