A museum construction expert will also share a brief overview of typical alternative design and mechanical decisions that are encounters in museum projects of all sizes both before and during construction. Comparisons between upfront and long-term operating costs and other impacts of such decisions, lending insights from the cost and client experience side.  The facilitator will encourage the audience and museum panel to consider and reconsider how their decisions, which may be cost or operationally based up front, will impact those costs and operations in the long run.
