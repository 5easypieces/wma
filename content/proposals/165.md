Creating coherent exhibitions that honor and enhance diverse voices and ideas takes thought and skill. Join us to examine the principles and practices underlying successful case studies with developed through-lines using story and poetry frameworks to guide the process. We’ll also examine classic “curveball scenarios” that can throw off best laid project plans, and in group conversations, generate potential solutions.
