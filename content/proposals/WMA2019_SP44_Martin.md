description: "Success for museums in the 21st century will rely on the ability to engage diverse audiences and change organizational practice.  In this engaging session, learn about three national initiatives that provide capacity-building support for museums focused on diversity, inclusion, equity and access.  Resources will be provided about how to access and apply for these three professional development initiatives and toolkits:  CCLI, MASS Action and iPage."
uniqueness: "Each of the national initiatives featured is innovative and impactful?this broad brush view will inspire participants to access excellent national resources focused on DEAI."
objectives: "With a broad overview of diversity/inclusion in the museum field, and an array of resources designed to support capacity-building for museums of all types, this session will ground participants in the issues of diversity/inclusion specifically for museums, from engaging diverse audiences to changing organizational practice, with a goal of transformation.  Participants will:||* Learn about 3 national initiatives that support capacity-building around diversity/inclusion/equity/access;||* Understand how they can access these resources and professional development models; and||* Be inspired and equipped with ideas to make change at their institutions"
engagement: "Beginning with an engaging exercise to help ground people in the many dimensions of diversity, and continuing with a historical overview of DEAI in the museum field, the session features presentations by leaders from each of the three national initiatives (CCLI, MASS Action, and iPage), showcasing similarities and differences.  With time for questions, participants will take away information about how their organizations can access these resources and apply for participation in the professional development programs. "
additional_comments: "Project Directors from both CCLI and MASS Action are confirmed speakers.  We are still waiting to hear back from leadership at iPage.  In addition, we have reached out to Joanne Jones-Rizzi as moderator, but have not yet confirmed.  It may be that, if leadership from iPage is not able to attend, someone from an organization who has participated in iPage could present on their behalf.  Will be working to confirm in the next couple of weeks and can notify WMA once we hear back.  "

theme_relationship: "* All three of the national programs encourage the following three bullet points mentioned in the ENGAGE theme:||* *Museums as inclusive places||* *Diversity in exhibits, programming, and on museum staff and boards||* *Museums as agents of social change / social justice
*Featuring these initiatives in one session and helping museum staff learn how to access them will be a fantastic approach to engaging long term around issues of DEAI. "
