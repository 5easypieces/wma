Questions to think about in planning your exhibits and programs, including audience, voice, place, how you use collections, photographs and videos.
Cutting edge strategies for sharing the connection between western STEM knowledge and Traditional Ecological Knowledge

We have a really great project, supported by the NSF, that is exploring how tribes and scientists work together, and how TEK can be a good model for informal science education. We have lots of cool jumping off points, which may not have fit exactly into the proposal format!
Also, any of the program formats could work for us."""
