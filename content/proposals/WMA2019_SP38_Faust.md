description: "Have you completed a collections move and found yourself left with a plethora of foam, polyester fiberfill, and boxes that you would happily share with another institution? Or maybe you?re moving out of a space and have storage furniture that you can no longer use? Repurposing archival materials and museum furniture takes time and effort, which is often not built into our job descriptions. As stewards of cultural heritage we?must be conscious of protecting our environment by?not creating unnecessary waste. This session will focus on creative and efficient?ways to share unwanted goods through?community resources, furniture vendors, social media, and?online classifieds.??"
uniqueness: "This session encourages museum professionals to consider the long-term repercussions of throwing away lightly-used materials and furniture. Beyond using consumer recycling programs this session will encourage museum professionals to leverage their existing networks and create new networks to share expensive, custom materials that are unique to our industry."
objectives: "Session attendees will:
*1) Feel empowered to repurpose materials
*2) Have access to existing networks for sharing museum materials
*3) Understand how to create their own local networks using models that other museum professionals have already created"
engagement: "The session will feature three speakers who will each present for 15 minutes. Speakers will share recent experience they have had with repurposing materials and highlight the resources they created or used. The remainder of the session will be filled by the moderator who will introduce the speakers as well as summarize the main take-aways at the end of the session. The session will end with a Q&A. Although still to be developed, I would like to create a recycling activity or challenge for participants to do, either at the conference or the moment they return to their museum. "
additional_comments: "I have two speakers confirmed. For the third speaker I would like to include a furniture vendor who has helped museums find used furniture, bought back used furniture, or helped repurpose existing furniture. I?m hoping there is a vendor who is planning to be in the Expo Hall."

theme_relationship: "Recycling and repurposing materials requires collaboration. When cultural institutions share goods they are forging new relationships, learning about other institutions' material standards, and connecting with their community and local businesses."

  reason: After spending six months trying to repurpose over 500 light canisters and lenses that were no longer needed at SFMOMA, I learned a lot about the benefits and challenges of recycling museum materials. During this project I reached out to colleagues to hear about their systems and struggles. As the primary contact and moderator for this session I?m able to bring together knowledgeable speakers as well as summarize the main take-ways from the session.
