description: 'Babies and work!  Babies at work?  Babies and no work? Hear true tales of 4+ babies born to museum professionals and their experience as mothers in the workplace.  Supportive?  Neutral?  Discriminatory?  Then work collectively with other participants to explore strategies to ensure museums have systems in place to achieve both what''s best for the museum and for their staff.  We?ll focus on parent-hood, but conversations will apply more broadly to any work/life balance. '
uniqueness: 'As a field (particularly one chock-full of women in their child-bearing years), do we really support young families''  We seek discussion leading to improvements.'
objectives: "1) Expose museum professionals to a variety of responses from institutions regarding maternity leave/parenthood in the museum to offer insight into some of the successes/problems in this area.\n*2) Through meaningful group discussions, explore both goals for museums to meet in this area and options for how to achieve those goals.\n*3) Open a forum for discussion on this topic that can be revisited in other formats/future meetings. "
engagement: 'Session will be a mix of PechaKucha to introduce some ideas, Spectogram to allow for participants to share their experiences and make meaningful groups for an Unconference-style discussion with some thoughtful prompts designed to help participants leave the session with a plan of action.  State-specific resources will also be made available regarding maternity leave and other pertinent information.'
additional_comments: 'We would definitely be willing to merge with another presenter/group.  We are actively seeking other presenters, particularly someone with an HR background, but if the proposal reviewers have suggestions, that would be great.'
other_comments: ""
theme_relationship: 'Creating a positive and caring work environment  - this is essentially the core of our session, which we will look at through the lens of maternity/paternity leave/parenthood.'

  reason: Lindsey has experience working at three different institutions during the births of her three children and the vastly different treatment received at each institution will provide food for thought for the group.  Lindsey also has experience leading teacher professional development and is skilled at mining the participants of a session for fruitful information and ensuring the discussion directly addresses the needs of the participants.

  reason: The concept for this session on motherhood in museums is Teresa?s ?brainchild.?  Teresa?s own experience with maternity leave/motherhood at her institution has inspired her to seek a better way to not only retain staff when they begin their families, but to ensure they thrive in their dual role of museum professional and parent.  Teresa is interested in encouraging creative solutions to this ?problem? and hopes to begin a dialog that will be continued through the years at WMA.

keynote_suggestions: ""
other_suggestions: ".||I love pre-conference field trips.  Please make sure there?s some options for that, because they?re great!  Also, sometimes there are some neat things happening in a city during/before/after the conference that attendees might want to take advantage of ? if there?s a way to advertise that, that would be great.  (For instance, Ira Glass was speaking at a city the day after the conference ended ? I know a great many people in the museum world who would have loved to extend their visit one day and see him perform, but that takes some advance planning.)||Also, I would be interested to explore the idea of childcare at the conference ? even if it is starting small (limited ages or limited times).  I am happy to help coordinate that effort if necessary, or at least provide some thoughtful suggestions of how I?ve seen childcare managed at other events.||Submission Deadline is November 30, 2018||Please email the completed document to proposals@westmuse.org||Thank you for your submission and supporting WMA!||We look forward to seeing you in Boise!"
