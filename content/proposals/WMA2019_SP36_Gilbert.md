theme_relationship: "This session explores the ways collaborative community partnerships can enhance community engagement for cultural institutions. Collaborative programs offer museums opportunities for greater relevance and relatability within their communities. Collaborating not only engages museum staff with other ideas and professional practices, but also engages a wider section of our community by providing a space for dialogue on contemporary social, political and environmental issues and ideas of importance.
