Due to the manageable time frame of this program as a 20-minute storytelling presentation, this session will (1) allow attendees to experience the program and then discuss it, in much the same way it has been shared throughout the East Coast and Hawai’i. (2) There will also be ample time to address the how and why of the particular programmatic choices, ie how the program was developed, researched, received, etc. Finally, (3) the session will conclude with a candid discussion as to the role of museums in facilitating dialogue and reconciliation and whether this is a model program, moving us forward.  It is also hoped that audience members will be inspired, seeing how effective storytelling is as a medium for conveying difficult subject matter, as well as taking way concrete advice on how to develop similar programs.
