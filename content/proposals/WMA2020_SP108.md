session_objectives = """WMA sessions often discuss program development, implementation, outcomes and impacts, yet rarely are we afforded the opportunity to experience the program itself. This session would be appealing to anyone in our field, but most especially museum educators and those enaged in public program development. Due to the manageable time frame of this program as a 20-minute storytelling presentation, this session will: (1) allow attendees to experience the program and then discuss it, in much the same way it has been shared throughout the East Coast and Hawai’i; and (2) discuss with the developer/presenter the how and why of particular programmatic choices, i.e. how the program was developed, researched, received, etc. Finally, there will be ample time for an engaged and candid discussion as to the role of museums in facilitating dialogue and reconciliation. By the end of this session, participants will: (1) experience the potential of storytelling is as a medium for conveying difficult subject matter; and (2) understand the basic elements of developing a museum theatre piece."""
session_engagement = """Audience members will experience a twenty-minute storytelling presentation and engage in a fifteen-minute discussion generated by the content shared (in much the same way it occured throughout the East Coast and Hawaiʻi). Resources needed may include a bench or table for the storytelling. Following the brief content-based Q&A, the moderator will facilitate a 30 minute group discussion around the development, implementation, delivery, impacts, and whether this can serve as a model program for moving "forward.""""

This session looks at how the 200th anniversary of the arrival of missionaries to Hawai’i’s shores served as a means of developing a presentation that shared Hawaiian perspectives on this complicated and contested history."""
