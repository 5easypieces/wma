description: 'Has your museum ever tried to engage audiences in controversial topics, moderate discussions about social movements, or introduce inclusive practices only to be stymied by your board or director?  Does it feel impossible for your museum to be an advocate for social justice issues'' This session is informed by the #museumsarenotneutral movement, the reality of museum professionals who can?t overtly address controversial topics, and a belief that ''museums are places that are quietly subversive.'''
uniqueness: 'Models DEAI work in a way that can be utilized by museums that are rural, small, or in very conservative locations.'
objectives: "1) Based on examples given by the presenters and audience members, participants will develop their own ideas about how to bring more inclusive practices and audience engagement techniques to museums of all sizes, disciplines, and geographic locations. Participants should glean at least a couple of concrete ideas that they could try to implement in their museum.\n*2) Participants will develop a sense of community and shared purpose by meeting other professionals who are struggling with the very same challenges of how to engage in diversity, equity, accessibility and inclusion work when they are being told by their boss or their board that they can?t do anything partisan at work, anything that takes a stance on a particular issue, or sometimes, even express an opinion outside of work. By growing their network, participants will gain new resources to call upon when they are back in their museum and encounter a challenge when trying to advance inclusion in their institution.\n*3) Participants and presenters will develop a counterpoint to the '#museumsarenotneutral' movement, by acknowledging that museums are not neutral (no organization or person is neutral), as well as recognizing the reality that the vast majority of museums are small and rural, and that the embodiment of '#museumsarenotneutral' looks very different in those institutions than it does in museums in large progressive urban areas. Participants will learn how to shake up the structure and dynamics of their museums by using more nuanced approaches to 'position' and 'tone' without acquiescing to cries for c'ivility.' "
engagement: 'Moderator will ask presenters one/two questions; presenters will answer based on their perspective. Moderator will ask follow-up questions and then solicit questions from the audience, to be answered by presenters and moderator. Session will end with a lightning round inviting audience members to share successful examples of inclusion in a rural, small museum, or conservative setting--or to express interest in a particular initiative so they can connect with peers who might have helpful suggestions.'
additional_comments: "Presenters were chosen to represent as many perspectives as possible:\n*Rural museum, small museum, and mid-size museum in a conservative city.\n*Natural history museum, art museum, history museum.\n*Moderator has experience working in all of the above."
other_comments: ""
theme_relationship: 'Session relates to the Engage theme as it is focused on audience engagement, pushing boundaries to be inclusive of new audiences while not alienating existing audiences. Focus will be on exhibitions and programming as well as how to work through conflict with staff and boards who might not be comfortable with inclusive practices. Presenters may touch on innovative partnerships and will certainly address museums as social change incubators.'
