Participants will recognize the unconscious ways western culture influences modern science by analyzing and discussing the STEM iconography. They will be asked to create and share new iconography that would better reflect the varying cultures and backgrounds that the participants come from. Participants will have guided reflective group discussions on exclusionary practices inherent in modern science & help each other to identify potential solutions. Participants will be given the Natural History Museum of Utah’s community norms and a list of practices that NHMU & Artes de Mexico en Utah have implemented that have helped to reframe science programming to be more culturally inclusive. The program “STEM Rooted in Culture” will be presented to participants as a case study of how the Natural History Museum of Utah and Artes de Mexico en Utah have implemented the aforementioned practices and community norms to create more inclusive educator workshops. Participants will hear from community partner, Artes de Mexico en Utah, about the value and authenticity of community involvement to empower community members and give opportunities for dialogue."""
