How does your institution authentically welcome staff whose identities fall on the margins? How do you make space for people of color and members of the LGBTQ+ community, as well as white people learning to be anti-racist? By building identity-based communities within, we can help advance equity efforts throughout our organizations. Hear from a panel of whose institutions have created Identity-Based Affinity Groups and how yours can, too!
