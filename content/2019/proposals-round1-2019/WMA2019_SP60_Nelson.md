  outreach and broader engagement with museum staff, exhibit designers,
  architects and the museum board to transform the outcome of exhibits and
  visitor experience.

  Challenge: The Nordic Heritage Museum was previously located in a 1908
  elementary school in a residential neighborhood with a membership of aging
  first- and second-generation Nordic immigrants. The Museum needed to re-engage
  a new generation of Nordic-American and non-Nordic audiences.

  *Solution: Engagement of a new generation was increased by creating a modern
  immersive Nordic experience. The new museum links exhibits and architecture to
  create a fully immersive and re-branded environment that includes a cafe,
  store and great hall. Programs and museum elements were reimagined for
  contemporary audiences: music, travelling shows, films, food and gatherings.
