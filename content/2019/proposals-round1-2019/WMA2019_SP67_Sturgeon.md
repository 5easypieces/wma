description: 'This perennially popular session investigates current best practices and choices made in creating exhibitions—this year, with the Idaho State Museum (ISM).  The critique will be of ISM’s  permanent survey exhibit, Idaho: The Land and Its People. Throughout history, Idaho’s land and people have shaped each other. Idaho: The Land and Its People offers visitors the opportunity to explore Idaho’s three geographic regions and discover the rich resources that influenced the Gem State’s development. The exhibit offers immersive environments, artifacts, and multi-media experiences to its guests to better bring Idaho’s cultural heritage to life.'
uniqueness: 'This session provides a forum for multiple perspectives from a variety of museum professionals to be expressed, and facilitates increasing our field’s creative tools.'
objectives: " - The session aims to inform members of the audience about ways of meeting challenges encountered while creating, installing, and showing exhibits -- issues for exhibit practice that the exhibit raises. Attendees at this session should engage with curatorial practice and visitor engagement through discussions revolving around best practices in exhibit work.\n- In addition to critiquing the single exhibit, the staff at ISM is also interested in hearing impressions from the critique panel and the audience about all the new exhibits and experiences at ISM, which reopened October 2018, after a four year closure.\n- Takeaways will be the notes (mental or written) that audience members make as they listen and participate.  Spontaneity is a hallmark of the session, so the specific takeaways cannot be predicted in advance. Past sessions have always generated new ideas and approaches especially for operationally bringing exhibits from idea to reality."
engagement: 'We will be piloting a new format for the Exhibit Critique session this year: fireside chats.  After my short intro to the panelists/participants and session, I&apos;d like to have a representative from the exhibit being critiqued make a short 5 minute visual introduction to the exhibit (with slides), then pair up one reviewer with one of the exhibit team and do more of a series of 12 minute conversations/fire side chats, where the reviewer calls out interesting and/or challenging aspects of the exhibit from their professional lens and/or their experience going through the exhibit and has a conversation with one of the exhibit team about those aspects.  That would leave about 30 minutes for audience questions and audience-driven conversation'
additional_comments: 'The session works even better when the exhibit being critiqued is the site of an evening event, so that many audience members will have seen the exhibit.  Placing the session on the last day of the conference may also encourage attendees to stay.'

theme_relationship: 'Few things in museums are more engaging than our exhibits. The ability for audience members to hone their exhibit critiquing skills, while learning from experiences of other professionals in the field, as we examine current exhibition practice, should leave all attending engaged in all aspects of the exhibit process and inspired to reflect on their own practice.'
