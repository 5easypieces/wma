  Museums need to adapt and reimagine the way they disseminate information to
  their changing audiences. Increasingly tech savvy and younger audiences simply
  do not relate to traditional exhibitions. This session will explore simple
  ways to know and understand your audiences, as well as how to integrate
  interactive technologies. Additionally, we will explore unique partnerships
  which help maximize the visitor experience and your budget.
uniqueness: >-
  The Old Idaho Penitentiary and the Idaho State Museum have forges a
  relationship with the Boise State University’s College of Innovation and
  Design to bring history to life through technology.
objectives: >-
  1. Recognize and identify the needs of your young and young at heart. These
  audiences desire more experienced-based, technology-driven, fast paced
  personalization at your site. They also want to know and understand the social
  impact today. 

  2. Demonstrate how collaboration within your community can become a benefit
  for all. This will include how to match the skill set of your partners with
  your audience’s needs. Additionally, this covers available resources like
  technology grants and allowing interns or the younger audience to plan and
  create your exhibits.
engagement: >-
  Mostly standard session with panelist presenting, using Power Point and other
  audio/visual tools. We would like to include session breakouts where groups
  use technology to answer questions and brainstorm about tackling a new exhibit
  using technology.
additional_comments: >-
  Yes we would be willing to merge with another similar session(s). Two of the
  presenters listed have not confirmed as of yet, but we are hopeful.
other_comments: >-
  This is not technology for technology sake. This is purposeful planning to
  engage an audience we might otherwise lose or become disinterested in museums
  long term.
theme_relationship: >-
  This is about engaging a new generation of museum –goers. This ensures that
  our stories are not lost because we use methods that do not stimulate young
  learners.
