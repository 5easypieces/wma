description: 'Many American Indian objects displayed in museums are exhibited for their aesthetic qualities without taking into consideration their cultural context.  The staff at the American Indian Cultural Center & Museum is developing an exhibition that not only takes into consideration the cultural context of objects but presents their stories as beings that are imbued with a living spirit.  Session will explore the way in which tribes and the community voice express cultural contrast in giving voice to our precious objects.'
uniqueness: 'Gives indigenous voice to cultural objects.'
objectives: 'Shares different cultural perspectives to museum practices.'

Many American Indian objects displayed in museums are exhibited for their aesthetic qualities without taking into consideration their cultural context.  The staff at the American Indian Cultural Center & Museum is developing an exhibition that not only takes into consideration the cultural context of objects but presents their stories as beings that are imbued with a living spirit.  Session will explore the way in which tribes and the community voice express cultural contrast in giving voice to our precious objects.
