  Programming is designed to engage existing audiences, and foster new audiences
  through mindfulness based activities in front of works of art. In addition,
  the programs address the societal need to unplug from a fast-paced and
  overwhelming world by providing spaces to slow down, and have meaningful
  interactions with themselves, fellow participants and works of art.
