    Professionals implementing collection-related tools/resources in small to
    midsize organizations looking for new ideas and resources to deal with
    strained resources.
description: >-
  Time and resources often impact what we can provide. Many of us have had to or
  are looking to find creative solutions within budget, resource availability,
  and institutional parameters, using ingenuity and creativity to enact high
  impact, low cost projects to a scale that fits our organizations' needs,
  abilities and goals. In small groups first, participants workshop their own
  project ideas and share time- and resource-saving options in order to move
  each other's projects forward.  
uniqueness: >-
  Participants have the opportunity to conversationally workshop specific
  project ideas to fit their needs, requirements and scale with the insights,
  support and input of colleagues. 
objectives: >-
  1. Empower participants through engagement by utilizing a format that puts all
  their tools and programming ideas, no matter the scale, on the same footing in
  discussing their issues and ideas amongst multiple peer viewpoints. This
  format is in particular support of those managing with limited resources such
  as budget, services, and staff. 

  2. Facilitate a community- and resource-building opportunity that brings about
  the showcasing and sharing of problem-solving ingenuity and need-fulfilling
  creativity programming and tools that are happening by professionals
  throughout the field.

  3. Offer participants opportunities to share and learn from each other's
  experiences and knowledge by workshopping ideas and getting direct feedback,
  thereby offering directly-qualifying tool and possible out-of-the box
  solutions that participants can use to enact and provide programs and tools;
  create group-built solution takeaway.
engagement: >-
  After introduction to whole group, participants take part in smaller
  discussion groups where each has the opportunity to share and workshop their
  project(s) including concerns, parameters and requirements. Their group offer
  ideas, past experiences, or resources that may help move each participant's
  project towards fruition. After the workshopping discussions, each group will
  add to the communal idea wall (shared later, digitally) matching the
  discussion handout, ie. projects, solutions, resources, and partnerships
  ideas; full-group wrap-up discussion.
additional_comments: >-
  While I would also reaching out to colleagues to help, I would welcome
  individuals who would be interested in being leads/group secretaries in the
  small discussion groups.

theme_relationship: >-
  The workshop session offers an inclusive space for a diverse set of voices
  (and ears) to pull together a widened range of solutions for actionable
  engagement of programming and tools by helping to find implementable
  solutions. Rather than a one-sided presentation where people take examples to
  reflect in silo, they can workshop their own ideas and utilize a wider range
  of experience and knowledge to engage.
