description: 'The relatively recent adoption of LED technology in museum lighting has presented both opportunities and challenges to museum professionals. This session will present an overview of internal case lighting systems implemented on recent projects The presentation will include a discussion of the challenges and successes.'
uniqueness: 'There are very few sessions presented at the AMA that reference exhibit lighting.'
objectives: '• Objective: Provide an overview of the challenges of working with LED lighting technologies for internal case lighting. Desired Outcome: Assist museum professionals in coping with the recent advances in LED lighting technology.                               • Objective: Discuss some of the do’s and don’ts of using LEDs for internal case
lighting. Desired Outcome: Assist museum professionals in selecting appropriate
case lighting solutions.                                    • Objective: Provide an overview of dimming options for LED case lighting.
Desired Outcome: Assist museum professionals in recognizing the challenges of
dimming LED sources and identify some strategies for success.'
engagement: 'The panel will speak to a Powerpoint presentation of representative projects and discuss the challenges, successes, and failures associated with each approach. Time will be allotted for an open discussion with session participants.'
additional_comments: 'We would like to include a panelist to provide an objective, outside perspective on the
presentation. We will approach senior decision makers on our selected projects to see if
someone is interested in filling that role. If not, we will request assistance.'

theme_relationship: 'The topic of ENGAGEment includes the statement that museums must address and adapt to
changes including “the current economic situation” & “climate change”. The adoption of
LED technology has a significant impact on climate change by reducing a facility’s carbon
footprint but the ability to realize that goal is limited by economic reality. Introducing LED
technology can have unexpected consequences and this session will address best practice
and potential pitfalls.'
