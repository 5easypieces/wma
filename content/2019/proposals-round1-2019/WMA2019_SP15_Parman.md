description: >-
  In this 'Westinar' locating expertise in everyone in the room, facilitated
  discussion invites exploration into what has called us to museums. What
  kindled our passion?childhood experiences or volunteering? How to keep going
  through ups and downs, and decisions to leave or stay?  Let's share our hopes
  and dreams of personal futures. The range of generations may provide insights
  into the differences of earlier informal versus current formal modes of entry
  into the field. (74 words)
uniqueness: >-
  Through active listening, participants will gain insight into
  intergenerational commonalities and differences, and how people at different
  career stages can serve and advance one another. (25 words)
objectives: >-
  * Tap the expertise in the room. Rather than a few experts sharing their
  knowledge in specific fields, as in a panel format, everyone in the Westinar
  is an expert on their own experience. Through thought-provoking questions and
  a proven facilitation method of active listening and sharing, we expect
  participants will come away with new ways of thinking about their own working
  lives and careers. 

  * Focus on the passion that motivates people in their work. Participants will
  reflect upon and share what inspired them to enter the field, and how that
  passion is holding up in practice. Through discussion, ideas will emerge for
  finding one's taproot, and how to refresh the wellspring of inspiration during
  a dry spell.

  * Acknowledge the varied perspectives of people at different life and career
  stages. Discussion will center around triads and foursomes whose composition
  will shift during the session. Some questions will be addressed among
  age/career stage peers, others among people of different ages and stages. An
  intended outcome is a recognition by everyone of the importance of mentoring,
  inclusion, and diversity in museum work. A second possible outcome is insights
  into how a project can be genuinely collaborative.
engagement: >-
  Participants will sit in a circle. In changeable triads and foursomes, they'll
  address a series of questions using these rules: Take turns talking and
  listening (2 minutes each way); everything said will be held in confidence. At
  some points we'll reform as a larger group, sharing perspectives on a
  voluntary basis. We'll also go around the circle at times, with the
  understanding that it's fine to pass. (67 words)

theme_relationship: >-
  We expect that our session will engage participants in a useful and memorable
  series of reflections on their own and others' experiences in museum work, and
  will model a format for facilitating discussion that may prove helpful when
  they return to their own institutions.

    Alice has some experience with this facilitation method, in a retreat
    setting and as a key part of an educational program. She has participated in
    small group leadership trainings with Christine Marie, a longtime
    organizational change specialist, now an ordained Episcopal priest. Rev.
    Christine designed and honed this approach over many years. In her work as
    an exhibit planner, Alice has facilitated hundreds of content brainstorming
    meetings. She finds the proposed approach attractive because it builds in
    restraints against one or more people dominating or hijacking the
    proceedings, and allows quieter folks to share and listen in smaller
    groups.  (99 words)
