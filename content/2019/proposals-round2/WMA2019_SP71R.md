session_desc = "Site-specific interpretation provides an authentic experience of place and creates a powerful lens into the legacy of an individual or cultural group. Providing visitors with a contextual experience is accomplished through methods tailored to each site's unique characteristics. This idea will be explored in detail through four locations: the Basque Block Museum and Cultural Center, James Castle House, Hemingway House and Preserve, and the Suquamish Cultural District."

session_objectives = "Objectives & Potential Outcomes:Explore Site-Specific Interpretation This session will explore interpretive and contextual approaches to institutions and districts that engage in site-specific and experiential ways. These include 1) the Basque Block, including the Basque Museum and Cultural Center, that occupies an urban block in Boise surrounded by immigrant-owned businesses; 2) James Castle House interpretive exhibits featuring work by outsider artist James Castle and rotating artists in residence; 3) the Hemingway House and Preserve; and 4) the Suquamish Cultural District comprised of the Suquamish Museum and House of Awakened Culture, host of tribal canoe journey landings and events like \"Sovereign Style\", a contemporary interpretation of traditional native fashion. Outcome/Takeaway: Participants will learn a variety of site-specific engagement methods that provide visitors authentic experiences of institutions and districts. Create a Dialog on Cultural Equity The four case studies will present an unlikely combination of subjects that address artistic creation and living culture through the lens of immigration, disability, mental health and historically oppressed people. Each of these case studies will foster a forum for a conversation on accessibility, representation, contemporary perception, stigma and personal voice. Outcome/Takeaway: Participants will consider how institutions can contribute to important historical understanding and social perspectives in their framing of the cultures and artists they celebrate.) Share Experience of Northwest Cultural Institutions and Districts This is an opportunity to compare and contrast four cultural sites that are unique to Idaho and the Northwest region. Outcome/Takeaway: WMA conference participants will explore the cultural diversity that abounds throughout Idaho and the Northwest region and the challenges and opportunities institutions have to interpret them."
engagement = "Modified Ignite Format Combined with a Moderated Panel: 10 Minute Introduction: The moderator will introduce the session and provide contextual and conceptual themes for panel discussion. 5 Minutes: Moderator will ask prompting questions surrounding \"sense of place\" to audience members. 32 Minutes: Key participants will share four case study examples with projected images in a modified \"Ignite\" format, 5 – 8 minutes each. 25 Minutes: Moderator re-ask prompting question to see if responses/perspectives have changed following panel case studies.
