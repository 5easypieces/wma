session_desc = "A year of planning. Stressed-out staff. Little or no profit. Now what? Sometimes the secret to success is in an epic failure. Three museum professionals map the road to success through detours of risks and failures. We will spark innovation and find success by identifying the best time for risk-taking, understanding the value of failing, and creating tangible evaluation with outcome-focused goals to turn colossal mistakes into successes. "
session_track = ""
session_type = "Standard panel (2 or more panelists)"
session_unique = "Most sessions, rightfully, boast about successful programs, but we often learn more from failure. This adds humor and candor in the serious business of successful failures."
session_objectives = " 1. Identify common patterns in \"failed\" events/programs. This entails tangible ways we can understand the role failures play in our successes. Talking about and learning from these failures will allow people the courage to try new things, with a new understanding of how to avoid repeating the same mistakes twice. 2. Demonstrate the value of risk-taking. There are very few successes without some element of risk. This session will help identify the best time to take those risks and what it can mean to long-term success and learning from short-term \"failures.\" 3. Evaluate through best practices andoutcome-based models. Listing the right questions to ask of your agency/museum and yourvisitors before and after programming/exhibits/etc. to ensure success."
engagement = "Brief case studies through PowerPoint and other handouts. Question & answer based on those experiences. Small group time to identify a failure that led to success and a necessary risk to take on, then demonstrating how to evaluate the success of that risk in the future. Small pocket-size handouts will be provided with the objectives in a practical \"how-to\" list. Audience participation via the #takingrisks during and after will be encouraged and measured while in small groups"
audience = "Planning staff (curators, event coordinators, etc.), but some emphasis on small museum staffs that do it all."
level = "From new employee to senior/executive staff"
other_comments = "Part of the lesson is in that program/event/exhibit planning should be on everyone's radar from customer service to Trustees."
theme_relationship = "This is all about engaging in the planning process. Encouraging innovation through calculated risk, learning from failure and understanding how to measure success through clear outcomes. Additionally, this demonstrates that purposeful planning is all about engaging your audiences in the right way to get them to show up for you. We will help session-goers imagine and re-imagine their ideas, tapping into our audience as well as our staff's creativity."
theme_comments = "This could easily be a stand-alone session or merged with a similar session(s). If merged there might be a need to pare down committed panelists. Always open to making it the strongest session possible."
