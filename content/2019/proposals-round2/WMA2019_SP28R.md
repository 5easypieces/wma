session_objectives = "Basque Museum staff assisted a researcher in the late 1990s who wasinterested in conducting interviews with immigrant Basque women since there wasvery little research or written information about women who came to thiscountry. Later, the Museum sent a photographerto capture the images of 41 women in environmental black and whitephotographs. In 2018, the Basque Museumembarked on Series III of the project, adding an additional 59 immigrant womenand 10 (90-100 year old) first generation women. Initiated in 2016, the Basque Community History Project arose from a concern that we were losing the stories and photographs of many immigrants and first and second generation Basques. Our goal is to inspire attendees to utilize versions of these two models intheir own institutions, large or small. Attendees will learn of techniques forengaging individuals to participate and data collection method take-awaysavailable. Processing and storage techniqueswill be presented along with ideas for how to utilize the resources collectedto expand their collections and to incorporate the information in variousmediums including exhibits with interactive components, catalogs, and via theInternet. Preservation of the information is a key component of both projectsas is making the information accessible to a wide audience. Time will beallowed at the end of the session for discussion among panelists andattendees. This session is appropriatefor employees or volunteers from small to large-sized institutions withpotential projects addressing a wide variety of themes applicable to individualgroups and communities."

theme_relationship = "Both of these projects required the engagement of people*going directly to communities, to organizations and literally door-to-door to individual houses to collect stories, photographs, and documents. Their stories, photographs, artifacts, and documents have then been shared through exhibits, through a catalog, and through a newly-created webpage. Multiple ways to engage the public and provide a resource to them."
theme_comments = "All of the presenters are local and are intimately involved in one of the projects used as case studies for the session. There would be too much content to merge with another session, unless it was expanded to a double session. We respectfully request that the session be held at the Basque Museum & Cultural Center (611 Grove Street), across the street from the conference center, so that attendees can experience the Inner Strength: Portraits of Basque Women exhibit that will be on display in the Museum's gallery."
