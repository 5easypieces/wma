session_title = "Seeding Authority: A Roundtable Discussion on Decolonizing Initiatives at Four Institutions"
session_desc = "Inspired by a recent Decolonizing symposium in Hawaiʻi, this session explores what happens when museums shift from \"ceding\" to \"seeding\" authority and view indigenous relations as acts that are generative rather than reductive. Staff from ʻIolani Palace, Bishop Museum, San Diego Museum of Man and UH Manoa share their experiences ranging from board dynamics to implementing decolonial policies to addressing historical harm as they sow seeds for a new future between museums and indigenous communities."

session_type = "rOUnd Table"
session_unique = "This roundtable invites an honest discussion around a variety of decolonial initiatives, demonstrating not only the ongoing difficulties but the mutual benefits."
session_objectives = " In November of 2018, the UH Manoa Museum Studies Graduate Certificate Program hosted a symposium on Decolonizing the Museum. It featured a keynote by Amy Lonetree, a panel with Ben Garcia and Kelly Hyberger of the San Diego Museum of Man, and two panels which highlighted various local initiatives. Attendees, which numbered well over 100 museum professionals, students, and community members, noted it was \"eye opening\" \"incredibly important\" \"relevant\" \"engaging\" \"compelling\" and that it was \"raw\" in its honesty as particular staff revealed the difficulties of being indigenous within their own institutions. Participants also noted the benefits of being professionally \"honest.\" This proposal is our effort to continue this dialogue in a museum setting and to invite some of the presenters back – not only to learn what has transpired in the year since the symposium, but to share whether the concept of ceding/seeding authority has impacted institutional conversations and initiatives. Specific objectives of the roundtable will be to:*share the work of those engaged in decolonizing initiatives (indigenous and indigenous accomplices), including online resources;*offer a variety of perspectives – as indigenous staff, indigenous allies/accomplices, administrators, and educators; and*discuss the challenges and rewards of decolonial practices, both personally and professionally. Specific outcomes include:*creating a more engaged, inspired, and empowered community of museum professionals who have gained knowledge on the practicalities, challenges and benefits of decolonization;*providing attendees with a safe space to share their own decolonizing experiences;*contributing toconversations around decolonization that are happening locally, regionally, andnationally and globally. "
engagement = "This round table session is intended to be conversational, honest, and practical. There will be no individual power point presentations. The moderator will pose a series of questions, soliciting responses from each participant, beginning with local/national decolonization efforts and then expanding outwards globally."
audience = "Members of any museum or community engaged in or interested in decolonization and relations between museums and indigenous communities."

theme_relationship = "This session will engage museum professionals, providing real-world guidance to indigenous communities and museums interested in pursuing decolonizing initiatives. It will also serve as a model of decolonizing practices by offering honest assessments and sharing personal stories, contextualizing how and why seeding authority as a mutually agreed upon practice matters. Finally, we wish to create a safe space whereby participants can share their own experiences (positive and/or negative) with decolonization."
