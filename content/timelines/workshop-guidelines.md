## Locations
If possible, all workshops will take place off site at local cultural institutions (not at the Annual Meeting hotel). This allows WMA to be more visible locally and support local institutions. The proposer may suggest a local cultural institution for their workshop location. If they do not have a contact, WMA staff will assign them a workshop location.
## Workshop Formats
Workshop formats will either be __Half-Day__ (9:00am – 1:00pm) or __Full-Day__ (10:00am – 4:00pm). This will be indicated in the initial proposal session form.

## Materials, Fees, and Lunch
Workshop materials are the responsibility of the proposer or moderator. These will not be organized by WMA.

The Workshop fee can cover basic materials (books, handouts etc.). Other major expenditures such as lunch or coffee service must have WMA approval in order to be addressed by the fee. Registration fees will be handled by WMA unless
otherwise agreed upon by the sponsoring affinity.

Lunch for workshop attendees is not included unless indicated in the fee, which is proposed by the workshop proposer. The proposer will work with the WMA staff regarding this item.

## Sponsors
We encourage workshops to be sponsored by an affinity such as:

* RCWR – [Registrar Committee Western Region](https://www.rcwr.org/)
* PACIN – [Packing and Crating Information Network](http://www.paccin.org)
* NAME – [National Association of Museum Exhibitors](https://www.name-aam.org/)
* MESC – [Museum Educators of Southern California](https://www.mesconline.org/)
* MTA – [Museum Trustees Association](https://www.museumtrustee.org/)

## Logistics
On the day of the workshop, if possible, a WMA staff member will be present to assist with registration.

Final registration lists will be given to workshop organizers in sufficient time to prepare materials etc.
