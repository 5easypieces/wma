## Other Arrangements

Depending on the availability/times of flights, you should consider coming the day before and leaving the day after the meetings. Everyone is quite friendly, and group dinners are the norm. WMA provides food and coffee during the meetings, but breakfast and dinner are at your own expense.

Also, we are planning an informal reception with the Board and the Host Committee on the evening of Thursday, January 18, 2018 - we hope you can attend.

Do you like playing in the snow? A few days before the PC Meeting, WMA is planning a trip to Crystal Mountain Resort for downhill skiing and snowshoeing. You can rent both skis and snowshoes onsite, and only need to bring good winter active wear! You are also welcome to attend the WMA Board meeting on Thursday January 18th. Please let me know if you are interested in one of these activities.
