## Other Arrangements

Depending on the availability/times of flights, you should consider coming the day before and leaving the day after the meetings. Everyone is quite friendly, and group dinners are the norm. WMA provides food and coffee during the meetings, but breakfast and dinner are at your own expense.

Also, we are planning an informal reception with the WMA Board, the Host Committee and the Oregon Museum Association's Board (and our partners) on the evening of Thursday, January 9, 2020 - we hope you can attend.

## Meetings:
