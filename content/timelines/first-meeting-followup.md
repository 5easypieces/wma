## Reaching out to assigned proposers

When you reach out to your assigned Proposers, please title the subject line as follows: Your WMA 2020 Proposal - SP# (this is the session proposal number found in the name of the document). Please ask the Proposers to review the Program Committees comments carefully and thoughtfully, and respond accordingly.

[Doc: Feedback template](/docs/WMA2019_Feedback-Template.docx)

1. Call or email proposers to share feedback from the Program Committee and suggested revisions (including speaker updates) to proposal. Please contact your assigned proposer by January 31, 2020.
2. Ask Proposer to rewrite their proposals taking into account the notes from the Program Committee. Remind them that they must confirm their list of speakers.
3. When instructing proposers how to resubmit their session, please ask them to re-title their resubmission document with their proposal number and an "R" at the end of the SP#, i.e."WMA2020_SP(#)R_"

The proposals must be resubmitted to proposals@westmuse.org no later than February 15, 2019. The material must be prepared and resubmitted in a timely manner for review, thus late resubmissions cannot be accepted.
