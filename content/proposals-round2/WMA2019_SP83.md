session_desc = "This workshop follows up on WMA’s successful 2018 Small Museum Legal Toolkit, which covered museum-specific legal issues and equipped managers and administrators of small museums without legal counsel with the information and tools they need to make informed decisions as to legal matters affecting daily operations. This year’s topics may include contracting basics, employment law (including interns and volunteers), exhibition and loan agreements, intellectual property, facility rentals, premises liability, and marketing / public relations legal issues."
session_track = ""
session_unique = "This workshop is unique because it delivers such a breadth of museum-specific legal information to attendees that had never been done at the WMA prior to 2018’s Small Museum Legal Toolkit workshop, which was very well-received."
session_objectives = "Objectives of this workshop:\n1.     Participants will\ngain a thorough understanding of the various bodies of law affecting museum\noperations.\n2.

audience = "Program and department managers, executives, and board members of small and medium-sized museums will benefit most from this workshop."
level = "Emerging through senior level."
other_comments = "This workshop is designed to be accessible to all participants regardless of prior knowledge or experience with law."
theme_relationship = "2019’s theme is “ENGAGE” and this workshop’s ultimate goal is to help attendees improve museum operations. Engagement with visitors, donors, community members, and other stakeholders occurs most effectively when a museum is focused on its mission and is operating efficiently. This workshop educates museum professionals on the “nuts and bolts” of museum-specific legal issues so that their museum will operate efficiently and they can focus on their mission. Upon completing this workshop, participants will be empowered with the knowledge and legal tools to maintain relationships with stakeholders, and improve operations – all vitally important for ENGAGEMENT -- and ultimately further their museum’s mission."

workshop_format = "Full-day"
workshop_fee = "The fee should be sufficient to cover one (1) one-inch three-ring binder with double-sided color printed material. The 2018 Small Museum Legal Toolkit Workshop had about 200 pages of materials, and we expect the 2019 Small Museum Legal Toolkit, if selected, will feature about the same amount of materials, too. We would also ask for WMA’s approval to include coffee service and a light lunch for this full-day workshop to facilitate networking among the participants during program breaks and the lunch hour."
