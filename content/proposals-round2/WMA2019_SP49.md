session_title = "?You Want to Do What?!?  The Challenges of Presenting Contemporary Art Installations"
session_desc = "Museums are often tasked with presenting contemporary art installations that don?t fit the mold of our traditional policies and procedures. How can we engage with contemporary artists without misunderstandings, conflicts, or frustrations so that we can fully present their visions while still adhering to best practices for risk management, ethics and registration methods'  "
session_track = ""
session_unique = "This will be an opportunity for museum staff to discuss problems, usually not shared beyond their own museum's walls, in an open forum for input.    "
session_objectives = "Examples will be presented of installations that were difficult to manage, either due to non-traditional materials, the risky manner in which they were presented, or tense relationships that emerged with the artists or their representatives. Perspectives of both registrars and curators will be included.  By frankly discussing problems encountered, mistakes made and solutions found, this session aims to foster an open discussion, including the audience, to increase our collective awareness of procedures and policies that need to be established or updated in our institutions.  Issues will include:  ||-Installation materials (e.g. live plants, mold, dirt, strong scents, sharp objects) that are potentially risky to visitors or the museum's internal environment.||-Division of museum staff responsibilities for the daily maintenance of A/V materials, and/or emergency cleanup responses for installations that are inherently messy.  ||-Insurance valuations which can be a source of conflict between museums and galleries.||-Dilemmas of how to track and describe works, such as performances, time-based media, or immersive environments, which don?t fit the traditional definition of loan objects or the fields provided by our collection databases.||-Policies for fairly sharing the burden and costs with artists and/or galleries for the repair or cleaning of components which are intended for interaction with visitors.||-Policies for keeping or dispersing components, provided and paid for by the host museum, after the exhibition closes. ||   ||-Ethics of when to consider an artwork as \"commissioned\" by the host museum and what happens to it after the exhibition closes."
engagement = "There will be 3 presenters; one presenter will also act as moderator.  Each will have 15 minutes to present an illustrated examples of difficult art installations they have experienced.  The moderator will then pose questions to the presenters as well as to the audience in order to foster discussion (approx. 30 minutes) of the issues raised, and to hear about other museums' issues, problems and solutions found when exhibiting contemporary art."
audience = "Registrars, curators, exhibition managers, risk managers, art installers"

theme_relationship = "In order to modernize our exhibition policies and procedures to be truly current, we must engage all involved staff so that all voices and concerns are heard and addressed.  With clear best practices established, we can then engage in a professional, consistent and timely fashion with artists and their representatives so that relationships remain smooth, artworks are presented at their best, risks to the public and the museum are minimized, and staff can maintain their sanity!"
