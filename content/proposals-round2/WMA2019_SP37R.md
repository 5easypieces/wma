session_title = "Inclusivity, Difficult History and the Modern Museum Audience"
session_desc = "There is increasing awareness of the need for museums to share the stories of people of all backgrounds. How do we tell the stories of people of color, differing religious backgrounds, ethnicities and orientations? How do we tell these stories in the context of controversy, crime or social justice? This session will uncover how to make institutions more inclusive through thoughtful interpretation."
session_track = ""
session_type = "Standard panel (2 or more panelists)"
session_unique = "Museums must navigate through difficult topics in order to become inclusive in an era where social justice is increasingly relevant. As museums face unique circumstances as private or government entities, this panel includes professionals with experience developing programs for private, state and federally funded museums."
session_objectives = "1. Identify opportunities to make an institution more inclusive and what the potential controversies are in sharing those stories thoughtfully. What hurdles you're your institution clear (or avoid) in order to establish these connections with visitors? Attendees will receive a handout featuring online resources tied to historic site and museum exhibits that reflect the issues discussed in this session. 2. Discuss how to properly implement interpretive exhibits, tour or educational programs, or special events thoughtfully, often with the help of outside scholars and community engagement. Museum professionals will discuss recent topical programs and exhibits they have created, including an Idaho Black History Museum exhibit on refugee resettlement in Idaho, the Old Idaho Penitentiary's interpretation of inmate stories representing diverse groups and how Idaho laws affected them, as well as interpretive programs at the Minidoka National Historic Site, the location of an internment camp for Japanese Americans during World War II. 3. Discuss methods ofaudience evaluation after your project is opened or completed. Are museumprofessionals prepared for honest feedback from visitors? Attendees willreceive three real examples of physical visitor evaluation components thataccompany exhibits relevant to this discussion."
engagement = "Because this session is based on experience with interpreting difficult topics, it will be primarily presentation and discussion based, with presenters using visual, PowerPoint and multimedia aids. Old Idaho Penitentiary, Idaho Black History Museum and the Minidoka National Historic Site staff will share their experiences, and audience members will be offered ample time to extend questions to the panelists and fellow audience members, with handouts and example evaluation methods provided to attendees."
audience = "Exhibit research and development staff, curators, docents and interpretive staff, and education and outreach coordinators"
level = "All"
other_comments = ""
theme_relationship = "This session approaches inclusivity as a way to allow all visitors to become connected with museums on a deeper level. The best way for museums to engage audiences is through relevant storytelling that presents topics in new and thought-provoking ways, and may even reach visitors no previous connection to the institution."
theme_comments = "This could certainly be merged with another session if needed. I would be happy to coordinate with presenters and adjust those needs if necessary."
