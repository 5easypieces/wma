The Chandler Museum, Nora Eccles Harrison Museum of Art, and Heard Museum have each endeavored to move beyond the walls of their building and find ways to engage with new audiences. Whether through renovation or reorganization, you will learn the importance of early and continued engagement with stakeholders and how their input can help guide programming in a positive and unexpected way.  "

Identify and explore the hidden potential of non-traditional museum assets. For example, programming outdoor spaces in creative ways, the use of light technology as a means for deepening visitor engagement.   \n*3. Evaluate whether strategies were successful, or how they could have been improved. Utilize visitor surveys to demonstrate how data can inform future decision making and programming."

Significant time was spent learning why stakeholders didn?t visit the museum, which led to follow-up discussions on how programming and strategic relationships could help improve attendance.  This effort was made in the design phase to engage new audiences, and presenters will share visitor feedback and data to illustrate the successful outcome of engaging new audiences, as well as the challenges.
