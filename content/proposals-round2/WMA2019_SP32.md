session_desc = "This session explores interactions amongst various stakeholders with a contested collection related to the incarceration of Japanese Americans during WWII. In 2015, a grassroots protest halted the auction that included artwork and crafts collected from camp inmates by writer/curator Allen Hendershott Eaton. The emotional protest and acquisition by a single community based museum raises questions about authority, community accountability, and provenance. Panelists share their roles in the collection's disposition, collaborations, and interpretation of objects."

session_objectives = "This double session panel will share the history of the Eaton collection. From its initial collection by Allen Hendershott Eaton for his book Beauty Behind Barbed Wire, to the subsequent transfer of this collection through different hands leading to the 2015 public auction and community protest, this collection has had an improbable journey across this nation. The communities' ability to organize and stop this 2015 public sale of Japanese American concentration camp artifacts is an example of how individuals and organizations can work together and have their voices heard. The Museum has since acquired the collection and is working closely with these groups to begin the long process of trying to identify all the items in this collection. The Museum is doing this by hosting a traveling pop-up display in locations across the nation where critical masses of Japanese Americans still reside. By sharing this story, our objectives are: \n*1) Participants will acquire practical knowledge of the role individuals and communities have in shaping the roles of Museums and institutions in relation to organizing and cultural/historical preservation.\n*2) Participants will be challenged to consider how Museums have to negotiate and reconcile collections management standards and institutional by laws with community access, usage, and accountability.\n*3) Participants will engage in discussion with key stakeholders and staff of different collecting institutions on the topic of audience focused, community-engaged, curatorial and collections practices.?"
engagement = "Panelists will present their distinct vantage points in relation to this grassroots protest. We seek the opportunity for exchange and discussion with colleagues from other institutions, to present for consideration the Eaton collection and its unique disposition into a broader discussion about preservation protocol, the implications of objects related to community history or cultural heritage, provenance and ownership of cultural history/heritage objects, connoisseurship, post-custodial collection strategies, and collaborative curation."
audience = "Museum professionals, historians, curators, collections, education, and others who hope to engage communities in their work."

In doing so, it illustrated the power we have when we work together. The All Camp Consortium, which represents many of these groups, is now working closer than sharing resources and lobbying government ensuring long lasting relationships and a unified voice moving forward.
