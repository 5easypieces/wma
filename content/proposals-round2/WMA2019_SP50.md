session_desc = "Whether you are setting your future direction, renovating, or building something new, planning is required. Questions abound: How much space? What will it cost to build or to operate? What can we raise? What will it look like? Planning can answer these questions, and more! Discover which plans will serve you, why, and in what order. We?ll discuss: Market Analyses, Capital Campaign Planning, Business, Institutional, Strategic, Concept, and Master Plans, Basis of Design, and others."

session_objectives = "1. Participants will explore the challenges and opportunities of different pre-design services and plans, and will be able to identify how these planning steps will benefit their projects.\n*2. Participants will discover who can provide these services, how predesign teams can be structured, and what types of inputs they use to produce their work.\n*3. Participants will be able to apply these planning techniques at their own organizations and/or on their own upcoming projects."
engagement = "This session will focus on Master and Visioning Plans, Capital Campaign Plans, Business & Institutional Plans, Strategic Plans, and Green Basis of Design. A panel of architects and consultants will discuss these services, how they interrelate, advise attendees about how and when to include contract planning services or develop them in house, and provide examples of organization, contents and timeline for various planning efforts. We will use a live audience polling system to interact with attendees and attain their feedback. "

theme_relationship = "Planning and pre-design can answer many questions and reveal vital information about project cost, long-term sustainability, operations, program, and political viability. Architects and planning consultants can engage with clients early and often as the preliminary data is gathered and reviewed, implications analyzed, and recommendations developed. In addition, the plans explored by our panelists will help clients discern how, when, and how much to engage with their community, donors, consultants, members, and their visitors. "
theme_comments = "We will use the time between now and the second submission deadline to find our last presenters that will best help us represent our proposed session. \n*We will would love to include Boise-based consultants and professionals from small museums, and are open to suggestions if it is of interest to the selection panel. We will be presenting a similar session at the Mid-Atlantic Association of Museums Building Museums conference, but would prefer to include speakers that are local and more relevant to your members and organization.
