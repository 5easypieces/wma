session_desc = "Has your museum ever tried to engage audiences in controversial topics,\nmoderate discussions about social movements, or introduce inclusive practices\nonly to be stymied by your board or director? Does it feel impossible for your\nmuseum to be an advocate for social justice issues? This session is informed by\nthe growing movement of museums and museum professionals working to dispel\nthe myth of institutional neutrality or nonpartisanship , the reality of museum\nprofessionals who can’t overtly address controversial topics, and a belief that\n‘museums are places that are quietly subversive.’"

session_objectives = "The intended audience for this session includes those who engage visitors\nand/or audiences at small or rural museums and/or any museum located\nin politically conservative communities. Based on examples given by the\npresenters and audience members, participants will develop their own\nideas about how to bring more inclusive practices and audience\nengagement techniques to museums of all sizes, disciplines, and\ngeographic locations. Participants should glean at least a couple of\nconcrete ideas that they could try to implement in their museum.\n2) Participants will develop a sense of community and shared purpose by\nmeeting other professionals who are struggling with the very same\nchallenges of how to engage in diversity, equity, accessibility and\ninclusion work when they are being told by their boss or their board that\nthey can’t do anything partisan at work, anything that takes a stance on a\nparticular issue, or sometimes, even express an opinion outside of work.\nBy growing their network, participants will gain new resources to call upon\nwhen they are back in their museum and encounter a challenge when\ntrying to advance inclusion in their institution.\n3) By going beyond the foundational concept that no organization or person\nis neutral, the session will investigate the unique realities faced by smaller\nmuseums and/or museums located in rural or conservative communities.\nParticipants and presenters will expand the conversation popularized by\nmovements such as #museumsarenotneutral to explore various ways in which the embodiment of equity and decolonization work manifests\ndifferently in those institutions than it does in museums in large\nprogressive urban areas. Session leaders will provide tools and insights\non how to push back and reconcile criticism, and provide tools for\nlearning how to shake up the structure and dynamics of their museums by\nusing more nuanced approaches to ‘position’ and ‘tone’ without\nacquiescing to cries for ‘civility.’"
engagement = "Moderator will ask presenters one/two questions; presenters will answer based on\ntheir perspective. Moderator will ask follow-up questions and then solicit\nquestions from the audience, to be answered by presenters and moderator.\nSession will end with a lightning round inviting audience members to share\nsuccessful examples of inclusion in a rural, small museum, or conservative setting\n– or to express interest in a particular initiative so they can connect with peers\nwho might have helpful suggestions. Takeaways will include:\n1. A reading list (exact titles TBD)\n2. MASS Action Readiness Assessment: a tool to help gauge your\ninstitution’s readiness for equity work, as well as identify and articulate\nareas for growth and opportunity."
