This panel explores how very different museums have begun using empathy after participating in The Empathetic Museum workshop offered at WMA 2018. What tools can lead to more equitable and inclusive museums? If your museum is struggling to engage your full community, you can benefit from this session as we define strategies to put to use and common pitfalls to avoid."

session_objectives = "Takeaways:\n  After attending this session participants\n  will \n  1.     \n  Learn how to use and place their organization within the\n  Maturity Model;\n  Participants\n  will understand that creating “diversity” isn’t about checking boxes or\n  counting up “minorities.” Instead, we seek to redistribute power and change\n  how we define our collections, exhibits, and programs.\n  programmatic\n  activities. \n  -define\n  key terms \n  -the\n  use and misuse of “diversity plans”\n  -we\n  each have a role, and a bias\n   \n  2.     \n  Be ready to initiate new equity and inclusion activities\n  in their strategic planning and daily work; \n  Empathy\n  take time to build, but it can be practiced and improved. And, becoming a\n  more empathetic museum is good for your museum and your community (and the\n  world!). Participants will develop a vocabulary, leave with a list of\n  resources, and learn about the efforts at work in other museums. We’ll use\n  the Calls to Action defined in Facing\n  Change to get started. \n   \n  3.      Know how to avoid\n  common pitfalls that occur in museums who are trying to do the “right thing,”\n  but result in further alienating constituencies, especially understanding that building empathy takes time.\n  Concrete\n  takeaways show how successful long-term strategies can drive attendance and\n  funding, while taking no action or attempting well-meaning, but short-sighted\n  activities have the opposite effect. \n   \n  Outcomes:\n1.)\tParticipants will have an increase understanding (via vocabulary, a resource list, and examples) of how to implement equity and inclusion activities. \n2.)\tThis introductory session will set the foundation to increase in quality and quantity of 2020 WMA session and workshop proposals for DEI at multiple stages of development and implementation (proliferation of sharing experiences and strategies)\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n"
engagement = "Single Session\n  Panel with Break Out Time\n  1.)   \n  Intro/Icebreaker,\n  Lisa Sasaki\n  Intro\n  to Facing Change and other resources.\n  Stacey and/or Janeen -  ask audience to\n  “think and write”, then “pair and share” how their institution fits the\n  Maturity Model (MM). Explain diversity dilemmas for end of session.\n  2.)   \n  Panelists define\n  their museum’s MM and offer progress and pitfalls \n  3.)   \n  General Q & A\n  4.)   \n  Divide into three\n  groups, discuss a diversity dilemma at each \n  \n \n\n\n\n\n"

theme_relationship = "Yes. If museums are to truly “engage” with their communities, then they must be representative of and by those communities. Understanding the perspectives and experiences of “others” and bringing observation to our own biases is not only critical to engaging people in the museum environment, but also crucial to next steps in our collective human experience"
theme_comments = "1.) Bryant and Mann will pre-record an introduction to the Maturity Model. (They are unlikely to be able to attend in person). The purpose of this is to ensure that Mann and Bryant are properly credited for their work, avoiding joining the prevalent pattern of racially biased citations (Ray, V. Inside Higher Ed, 27 April 2018).\n 2.) I have invited two additional panelists, Kristen Mihalko, who also attended the 2018 Workshop and Brian Carter, executive director of the African American Museum Association. Kristen may only be able to attend the panel if it is scheduled for Monday afternoon or Tuesday. I have not had confirmation from Brian Carter.\n 3.) I did reach out to Jim Cullen per the WMA program committee’s suggestion, but Cullen is most likely not available to attend. His schedule may change and we remain in conversation."
