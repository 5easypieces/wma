To create an\n  intentional visitor experience and shape relevant and impactful exhibition\n  content, ISHS created an inclusive system of community engagement, including focus groups, electronic surveys,\n  workshops, small group meetings, an ongoing partnership with Idaho’s five\n  federally recognized tribes, an Educator Advisory Council, and collaborative\n  with 70 university academics\n  and local scholars across Idaho.  \n  Session objectives include:\n  To illustrate how statewide formative evaluation was conducted\n  between the schematic design and design development exhibition phases to\n  inform decisions regarding final exhibition content and design. \n   To share the process of inviting Idaho’s\n  five federally recognized tribes to serve in a leadership role in the\n  development of tribal exhibition content. \n  \n To demonstrate affective outcomes (knowledge and emotional impact) of the museum experience\nthrough data gleaned through summative evaluation and how this data is\ninforming, in real time, responsive decision making to serve audience\ninterests. \nSession participants will:\n   \n  Understand\n  approaches in engaging a statewide audience in museum development and how\n  that engagement, including tribal participation, influences decisions about\n  audience experience, including exhibition content, design, and multi-media to\n  respond to community needs and interest \n   \n  Understand\n  how to implement cost effective pre and post evaluation and  understand affective outcomes of visitor\n  experience \n   \n  Understand\n  how to apply data to inform museum operations, help to prioritize new program\n  development to serve community needs, and target communication efforts.\n"
