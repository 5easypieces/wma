Panelists will present what motivated the initial development of the community advisory committee, the steps taken to recruit/invite members, the roles of participants on the committee, and examples of the benefits and/or challenges associated with long-term engagement. Panelists and session attendees will then divide into groups and discuss specific, practical questions in a small-group format."
