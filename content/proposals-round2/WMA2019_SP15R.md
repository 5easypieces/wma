Facilitated discussion invites reflection on our relationships with museum work—what pulls us in, what pushes us away, what maybe keeps us here? How to keep going through ups and downs, and decisions to leave or stay? Let’s share our hopes, dreams, and puzzlements. The range of participants--emerging professionals to veterans--may provide insights into earlier informal versus current formal modes of entry into the field. (74 words)"

session_objectives = "• Tap the expertise in the room. Unlike a panel\nformat, everyone in the Westinar is treated as an expert. Through\nthought-provoking questions and an unusual, proven facilitation method, we\nexpect participants of all stripes to discover new ways of thinking about their\nworking lives.    \n\n• Engage the passion that motivates people in their\nwork. Participants will reflect upon and share what inspired them to enter the\nfield. Is that passion holding up in practice? How can one find or re-engage a\ntaproot, to provide a wellspring during a dry spell? \n\n• Acknowledge the value of different life and career\nstages; model reflection as an integral part of professional practice.\nDiscussion will center around small groups whose composition will shift during\nthe session—age/career stage peers versus people of different ages and stages.\nAn intended outcome is a recognition of the importance of mentoring, inclusion,\nand diversity in museum work. A second possible outcome is insight into the\nvalue of taking “time outs” to reflect individually and in groups on their\nsense of well-being and purpose on the job. This practice can be of direct use\nfor supervisors who want to attend to the whole person/needs of their staff. It\ncan also directly help make a project more genuinely collaborative.  \n\n•\nModel listening and taking turns. Participants will take away a firsthand\nexperience of this discussion method in action, and receive a handout with\nspecific steps, rules, and tips for applying this alternative approach to\nbrainstorming and general discussion in a variety of settings. (250 words)  "
engagement = "In this alternative approach to facilitated discussion, everyone gets to talk and everyone practices active listening. Participants sit in a circle. In changing triads and foursomes, they'll address a series of questions using these rules: Take turns talking and listening (2 minutes each way); everything said will be held in confidence. At key moments, we'll gather as a whole group, sharing perspectives on a voluntary basis."

level = "Emerging professionals, mid-career professionals, seasoned professionals, board members, volunteers--anyone engaged in museum work or seeking to enter the field."

theme_relationship = "We intend our session to engage participants in a useful, memorable series of reflections on their own and others' experiences in museum work. We will encourage moving away from a schema of success/failure to one of well-being, and flipping the normal professional focus of engagement from the visitor to the staff—what makes them engaged in their work and what makes them feel disengaged? How can they stay engaged? Does that change over time? (74 words)"

Christine designed and honed this approach over many years. In her work as an exhibit planner, Alice has facilitated hundreds of content brainstorming meetings. She finds the proposed approach attractive because it builds in restraints against one or more people dominating or hijacking the proceedings, and allows quieter folks to share and listen in smaller groups.
