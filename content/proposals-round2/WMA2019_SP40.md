session_title = "Old Shoes and New Tech: Crafting a Mutually Beneficial Museum-University Project"
session_desc = "What happens when you bring together a collection of women's shoes, a history class about women in the U.S. West filled with students from several disciplines, a makerspace, and digital technologies' Maker and curatorial magic! Come learn how a partnership among curatorial and registration staff, a history professor, a librarian, and an instructional designer increased students' understanding of women's history, led them to think of themselves as makers, and resulted in interesting interpretations of an overlooked collection."
session_track = ""
session_unique = "Because this partnership focused on using historical artifacts to increase both students' understanding of the past and their digital savvy, museum staff gained both pedagogical and technological insights."
session_objectives = "By the end of the session, participants will:||- learn how one high-impact, low-cost case study was organized and assessed.||- consider how best to structure similar, sustainable projects in their institutional contexts in ways that benefit all participants.||- identify benefits and potential pitfalls in working with students, faculty, and others on a university timeline."
engagement = "After we briefly summarize the goals of the collaboration, outline our process, and share some student work, we will walk participants through active learning and discussion that will help them develop their own productive collaborations. We will employ several different brief activities (e.g., carousel, think-pair-square-share, gallery walk, large- or small-group discussion) to push participants to think creatively about potentially high-impact partnerships."
audience = "Collections, curatorial, and education staff; university faculty"
level = "All, but probably especially useful for mid-career and higher"

theme_relationship = "Our project was a high-engagement collaboration among collections staff and people from different parts of the university?a professor, an instructional designer, a librarian, the campus MakerLab, and students from several disciplines ranging from criminal justice to education, history to gender studies."
theme_comments = "Confirmed speakers: ||- Sarah Phillips, Curator, Idaho State Historical Museum; ||- Nicole Inghilterra, Registrar, Idaho State Historical Museum; ||- Leslie Madsen, Associate Professor of History and Director of Instructional Design and Educational Assessment (IDEA Shop), Boise State University. \n*Additional collaborators who may participate (their schedules aren?t yet known):||- Amy Vecchione, Faculty Librarian and  Head, Emerging Technology & Experiential Learning, Albertsons Library, Boise State  University; ||- Brian Martin, Instructional Design Consultant, IDEA Shop, Boise State University.\n*If there's another session about museum-university collaborations, and they?re dedicated to active learning rather than simply lecture/presentation, we?d be open to combining with them, possibly for a longer session, depending on their goals."
