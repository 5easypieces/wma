session_desc = "Can practicing empathy evolve museums from \"paper\"paperdiversity plans to meaningful change? This panel explores how very different museums have implemented changes after participating in The Empathetic Museum workshop offered at WMA 2018. What tools have been useful in creating more equitable and inclusive museums' If your museum is struggling to engage your full community, you can benefit from this session as we define strategies to put to use and common pitfalls to avoid."

session_unique = "The session will be innovative because we will involve our audience in reflecting as individuals and as organizations."
session_objectives = "After attending this session participants will \n*1. Be able to place their organization within the Maturity Model;\n*Participants will understand that creating \"diversity\" isn?t about checking boxes or counting up \"minorities' Instead, we seek to redistribute power in making key decisions that define our collections, exhibits, programs and all strategic and programmatic activities. ||-define key terms ||-the use and misuse of \"diversity plans?||-we each have a role, and a bias\n*2. Be inspired to initiate new equity and inclusion activities in their strategic planning and daily work; \n*Empathy can be practiced and improved. And, becoming a more empathetic museum is good for your museum and your community (and the world!). Get started by developing a vocabulary, building a list of resources, and learning about the efforts at work in other museums. We?ll use the Calls to Action defined in Facing Change to start your efforts today.\n*3. Know how to avoid common pitfalls that occur in museums who are trying to do the \"right thing,\" but result in further alienating constituencies.\n*Concrete takeaways show how successful strategies can drive attendance and funding, while taking no action or attempting well-meaning, but short-sighted activities have the opposite effect. \n*Outcomes:\n*1.) Increased interest and competency in developing and implementing DEI Plans (increase skills; flood the market)\n*2.) Increase in quality and quantity of 2020 WMA session and workshop proposals for DEI at multiple stages of development and implementation (proliferation of sharing experiences and strategies)"
engagement = "Single Session\n*Panel with Break Out Time\n*1.) Intro/Icebreaker, Lisa Sasaki\n*Intro to Facing Change and other resources. Stacey and/or Janeen -  ask audience to \"think and write?, then \"pair and share? how their institution fits the Maturity Model (MM). Explain diversity dilemmas for end of session.\n*2.) Panelists define their museum's MM and offer progress and pitfalls \n*3.) General Q & A\n*4.) Divide into three groups, discuss a diversity dilemma at each "

theme_relationship = "Yes. If museums are to truly \"engage? with their communities, then they must be representative of and by those communities. Understanding the perspectives and experiences of \"others' and bringing observation to our own biases is not only critical to engaging people in the museum environment, but also crucial to next steps in our collective human experience."
theme_comments = "1.) If internet connectivity allows, Bryant and/or Mann will participate during the introduction of the session via Skype. (They are unable to commit to in-person visit at this time). If internet capability is not available, Ann will pre-record a virtual introduction with them and play it for the audience. The purpose of this is to ensure that Mann and Bryant are properly credited for their work, avoiding joining the prevalent pattern of racially biased citations (Ray, V. Inside Higher Ed, 27 April 2018). \n*2.) I invited Patrick McMahon from the Gates Foundation Discovery Center as the third panelist. After careful consideration, the organization will not be able to participate. However, I am confident I can locate a third panelist who either participated in the workshop or is practicing the work of equity, inclusion, and accessibility. I am open to any recommendations from the committee. "
