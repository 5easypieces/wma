Come hear examples of scaling projects and ideas in collections, fundraising & administrative practices, and digital projects while testing your hand at workshopping scaling ideas for your museum. ||\t"

engagement = "The intended session format will be a combination of a traditional three speaker panel with a majority of the time spent on breaking out into small groups to work through scalability worksheets with provided sample examples. Each of the presenters will present on their area of expertise (Collections, Admin/fundraising, Digital Projects) followed by a hands on session for attendees. Additional resources will be sent to WMA admin following the conference for attendees to access via the website. "
