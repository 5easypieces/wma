Has writer’s block ever stymied your efforts to craft the perfect request for support of a special project? Do you sometimes struggle to translate passion for your museum into a compelling message? If you answered yes to any of the above, then this session is for you! Learn from a panel of professional s that represent museums of all sizes and take away tips for engaging donors."

session_objectives = "Attendees\n  will…\n   \n  1.\n  Learn how to articulate their passion for the work of the museum in clear and\n  accessible language. The why of our\n  work is so often overlooked, in favor of messages about how many artifacts\n  were preserved or the number of school children that visited. \n   \n  2.\n  Be asked to consider the relationship between the institution and the\n  community. By illustrating how a museum makes the entire community a better\n  place to live and work, donors can better understand the impact of their\n  gift. \n   \n  3.\n  Take away tips for specific language that has worked (and perhaps some that\n  has not). A list of good online resources for learning more about best\n  practices could also be shared.   \n  \n \n\n\n\n\n"
