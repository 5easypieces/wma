Think of the store as the final portion of\n  the exhibition—what are the main points to address?  Learn how to make subtle changes for\n  maximum effect.\n  2.     What is the\n  knowledge level of your store personnel? \n  Are they able to talk about how the merchandise is relevant?  Have your collaborated with the curatorial\n  team?  Can staff engage your visitors\n  and do they aim for 100% sales, build the museum brand and develop long-term\n  relationships with their visitors? \n  Learn how to train store staff to reach their fullest potential.\n  \n Ask questions—need help with something in your\nstore?  Ask your colleagues for advice.  Take home some revenue-generating information."
