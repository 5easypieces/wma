Understand IMLS Museums for America application elements: participants will have a\n  step-by-step explanation of each element that is required to submit to the\n  federal government when applying for funds as well as how to fill them out.\n  3.      Thoughtfully analyze your Museum’s strategic direction: participants will understand how to use their Museum’s mission and strategic plan to help develop projects where engagement is central.\n   \n  Outcome: Participants will leave\n  with a clear knowledge of how to approach a federal agency when applying for\n  a grant.\n   \n  Outcome: Participants will be able\n  to ask questions based on their own project ideas.\n   \n  Outcome: Participants will be able\n  to leave the session with practical tools to bring back to their Museum and\n  share with colleagues\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n"
