How can we best prepare for natural (or unnatural) disasters that we didn?t see coming? What are the first action steps we need to do to minimize damage? This session will walk through creating a disaster preparedness plan for your institution, provide resources for emergencies, and help you know how to react when disaster strikes. "

session_objectives = "Objectives: Learn what resources are available for museums in the event of a disaster. Learn to create detailed disaster response plans. Have directions on how to react at the start of the disaster to hopefully minimize damage to collections (if possible). \n*Outcomes: The attendees will be broken into groups and asked to apply what they learned in the session to tackle disaster examples given to them. Attendees will leave with disaster plans started for their institutions and directions on implementing their plans. "
engagement = "The session will begin with speakers talking about resources, planning, and what can be done to minimize damage in a disaster. The attendees will then be broken into groups and given a disaster example to mitigate. Solutions will be shared with the whole group at the end.
