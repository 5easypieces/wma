session_desc = "Everyone learns in a museum, but exactly what and how they learn…now that depends on a few things. We’ll be sharing educational supplements we’ve created to target school-age visitors and different methods we’ve tried that have an impact on students’ learning, memory, and overall experience. We’re eager to hear about practices that have worked for you, too, so we’ll save some time for sharing. We encourage you to bring examples to show off your work!"

session_objectives = " - Gain an understanding of Vygotsky’s “zone of proximal development” which explains the\n  dynamics of group learning. Because most visitors attend museums in some sort\n  of group (whether school or family), this theory should inform our practice\n  in terms of how we plan our activities and programming in ways that best\n  facilitate this type of learning. \n  -       \n  Review Eilean\n  Hooper-Greenhill’s “Generic Learning Outcomes” and John Falk’s theory of\n  identity and motivation. Placed within this context, the level of prior\n  knowledge (or lack thereof) a person walks into the museum with will\n  influence the way they respond to the exhibit. \n  -       \n  Understand the\n  different ways students will respond to, learn from, and engage with your\n  exhibits, depending on variables such as prior knowledge, level of interest,\n  etc. \n  -       \n  See examples of\n  how to engage with educators before, during, and after their visit to ensure\n  everyone’s educational needs are met, and feedback museums can use for the\n  future.\n  -       \n  Facilitate useful\n  brainstorming and sharing for attendees to think about how they can refine,\n  modify, or engage in new practices to engage their audiences.\n  -       \n  Walk away with\n  some physical examples to take back to your institution, questions to provoke\n  thinking, and ideas to consider implementing!\n\n\n"
engagement = "Ideally, we would have a panel of three presenters briefly share work from their institution in regards to learning and engaging school-age visitors. After a brief Q&A about those presentations, we’d like to then facilitate a conversation among the participants with a series of questions. Wrapping our session to a close, some can share takeaways or make a commitment to at least one small step they can take back to their institution."

Knowing that, catering programming, educational supplements, etc. to align with their motivations and interests to ensure their engagement during the museum visit. Ultimately, it’s about how to ensure your offerings engage visitors of all types—regardless of why they’re there or who they’re there with."
