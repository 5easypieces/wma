Grant funding is repeatedly sought to fill the gap needed for staff, supplies, and projects. The session will offer a sandbox for constructing competitive grant project ideas, reveal proposal pitfalls, and provide a template for creating a winning grant proposal. This workshop is for anyone who is part of an under-funded organization."
