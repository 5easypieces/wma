session_title = "\"You Want to Do What?!\" The Challenges of Presenting Contemporary Art Installations"
session_desc = "Museums are often tasked with presenting contemporary art installations that don't fit the mold of our traditional policies and procedures. How can we engage with contemporary artists without misunderstandings, conflicts, or frustrations so that we can fully present their visions while still adhering to best practices for risk management, ethics and registration methods?"
session_track = ""
session_type = "Standard panel (2 or more panelists)"
session_unique = "This will be an opportunity for participants to openly discuss difficulties we often encounter with contemporary art installations, in order to develop best practices"
session_objectives = "Examples will be presented of installations that were difficult to manage and the lessons learned from them. Perspectives of museum staff as well as artists will be included (the presenters will gather feedback from artists prior to the session). We aim to foster an open discussion, including the audience, to frankly share experiences and suggestions for enhancing best practices -- in any kind of institutional setting -- for presenting works by living, contemporary artists. Objectives include better understanding and tools for various challenging situations, including: When an artist is new to the museum world: How to communicate our institution's particular needs, timelines and restrictions in a clear and productive manner, so that the artist, the museum and the public will have a successful experience. When an artist proposes to use non-traditional materials that are potentially risky to people, the museum building, or other artworks, (e.g. live plants, mold, dirt, strong scents, sharp objects): Who of the museum staff should be involved in the decision-making process, and what are some possible external resources available to support decisions. When artists or their galleries are the lenders of the exhibited works: Written agreements to be used, and special language that can we included in order to clearly establish the various parties' responsibilities and obligations regarding costs, insurance, and ownership. Presenters willprovide examples of updated procedures their institutions have established, aswell as documents they have created or updated. Participants can either takeaway hard copies or receive soft copies later."
engagement = "There will be 3 presenters and one moderator. Each will have 15 minutes to present examples of difficult situations and lessons learned. The moderator will then pose questions to the presenters as well as to the audience in order to foster discussion (approx. 30 minutes) of the issues raised, and to hear about other institutions' issues, problems and solutions found when exhibiting art by living contemporary artists."
audience = "Registrars; curators; exhibition managers, designers and installers."

theme_relationship = "To enhance best practices for exhibiting contemporary art, we must engage all involved museum staff so that all voices and concerns are heard, and establish clear procedures so that staff and artists know their responsibilities. We can then engage in a professional, successful manner with artists and their representatives so that relationships remain smooth, artworks are presented at their best, risks to the public and the museum are minimized, and staff can maintain their sanity!"
theme_comments = "One of the presenters is obligated to be at their museum on Monday, Oct. 7th for an exhibition installation; therefore we would appreciate a time slot on a day that is *not* Monday, thank you"

She learned registration procedures from the Museum Registration Methods and through experience, not school. Each of the contemporary art exhibitions she has worked on, particularly in the last 8 years, have presented new and different challenges which are typically not covered in the \"Registrar's Bible\". She is eager to foster frank discussions within the museum world and hopes to contribute to developing best practices in this area."

Also, BAM is a non-collecting museum, which is a slightly different situation than the museums of the other speakers."
