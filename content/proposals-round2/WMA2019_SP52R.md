engagement = "We’d like to encourage the audience to remove their Western lenses and discuss with us how they can sustain Native philosophy through their care of Native collections and promoting and validating Native knowledge, worldviews, beliefs, and philosophies. We’d like to start by asking the audience to write a label for a rattlesnake basket—what does the label look like? Usually: Basket, artist name, materials, date, rattlesnake design. In this session, we’d like to look at those descriptions and rework them putting the basket in a cultural context relating to the Peoples’ philosophy: Kumeyaay basketmakers often wove rattlesnake designs into their baskets as a daily reminder of the gifts they received from their Creator. The Creator came to the People in their time of need, returning to them as a giant snake. His corporeal body exploded and the People ingested the Creator’s body, giving them the knowledge they needed to live upon the land."
