session_title = "Recycling and Reusing Archival Materials and Museum Furniture "
session_desc = "Have you completed a collections move and found yourself left with a plethora of foam, polyester fiberfill, and boxes that you would happily share with another institution? Or maybe you’re moving out of a storage space or just closed an exhibition and have furniture that you can no longer use? Repurposing archival materials and museum furniture takes time and effort, which is often not built into our job descriptions. As stewards of cultural heritage we must be conscious of protecting our environment by not creating unnecessary waste. This session will focus on creative and efficient ways to share unwanted goods through community resources, furniture vendors, social media, and online classifieds."

session_unique = "This session encourages museum professionals to consider the long-term repercussions of throwing away lightly-used materials and furniture. Beyond using consumer recycling programs this session will encourage museum professionals to leverage their existing networks and create new networks to share expensive, custom materials that are unique to our industry."
session_objectives = "Session attendees\n  will:\n  1)     Feel\n  empowered to repurpose materials\n  2)     Have\n  access to existing networks for sharing museum materials\n  3)     Understand\n  how to create their own local networks using models that other museum\n  professionals have already created\n  The session will\n  provide a handout with:\n  1)     Common\n  recycling resources\n  2)     Helpful\n  recycling tools/procedures that attendees can implement when they return to\n  their museum.\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n"
engagement = "The session will feature three speakers who will each present for 10 minutes. Speakers will share recent experiences they have had with repurposing materials and highlight the resources they created or used. After the three presentations, attendees will break into four groups (moderator and speakers will be group facilitators). The groups will each be assigned a hypothetical situation and will be asked to come up with a creative recycling proposal. Everyone will then come back together and groups will report out. The session will end with the moderator asking attendees to share their recycling resources. The moderator will make a list that can be shared with the group digitally. Questions for the speakers will also be encouraged. "

During this project I reached out to colleagues to hear about their systems and struggles. As the primary contact and moderator for this session I’m able to bring together knowledgeable speakers as well as summarize the main take-ways from the session."

Throughout the project, she worked with furniture vendors to come up with creative solutions for re-using and re-locating preexisting storage furniture. At the end of the project, the Hearst team found themselves with an excess of packing materials that they couldn’t use and didn’t want to put in the dumpster. Katie reached out to community organizations and utilized online classifieds to creatively repurpose materials."
