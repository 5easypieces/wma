session_desc = "Does your museum need budget-friendly directions to improve its community engagement, address challenges with collections, strengthen its educational activities, align operations overall, or hone its governance for greater leadership potential? The Museum Assessment Program can give your museum the best route to reach your destination. Hear about the new and revised assessment options; and the benefits, experience, and results of MAP from recent participants. Fuel up to apply for this IMLS funded excellence program today."

session_type = "Standard panel (2 or more panelists)"
session_unique = "Museums are hungry for ways to professionalize operations, improve sustainability and increase stakeholder engagement. Two MAP museums are thrilled to share success stories and tips."
session_objectives = "After coming to this\n  session, senior staff and museum leadership from small to midsized museums\n  will:\n  ·      \n  Understand the MAP process, the\n  new/revised assessments, key aspects of the process/program and understand\n  the value of self and peer assessment as a way to engage with the larger field\n  and strengthen the organization, so it can better serve its community and\n  stakeholders.\n  ·      \n  Learn how 2 very different museums\n  leveraged assessment successfully and be motivated to include assessment in\n  their own museum’s future goals.\n  ·      \n  Use a questionnaire to determine which\n  type of assessment is the best fit for their museum and receive assessment\n  handouts to take back to stakeholders and co-workers.\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n"
engagement = "This 75-minute session blends a micro-presentation of information about MAP (steps, options, cost, etc.) by the MAP facilitator, followed by a lively discussion between the facilitator and two MAP participants about their museum’s experience. Q & A is invited at several points. Attendees complete a written questionnaire to help determine which assessment type is the best fit for their museum, with more discussion following. Handouts will summarize assessments, costs, timing, and deadlines."

theme_relationship = "In addition to all the MAP assessments themselves (Organizational, Community Engagement, Collections, Education, Leadership) the nature of the process creates internal and external engagement experiences for the museum. The self-assessment forces staff and board members to work together and engage deeply with museum’s core mission. The site visit connects the museum with a peer, exposing them to standards and best practices. Overall MAP gives museums the opportunity to engage with the broader museum community."
