session_objectives = "Many university students are first-time museum visitors and represent a huge range of personal backgrounds, learning styles, and academic and career interests. This session will consider how museums can best work with the diverse range of university students who visit the museum through courses and class visits, including art and non-art subject areas. We will explore how museum staff and faculty can pave the way for students to make new connections to the content in their courses, consider personal connections to works of art, share and build ideas and interpretations together through dialogue, and make the museum an active learning environment. Examples will range from a semester-long museum education course that met and led tours in the museum to materials developed to engage students as they explore the museum on their own or with peers.\nOutcomes:\n1. Participants will leave with specific ideas on ways they may engage\n university students at the museum through university courses and campus connections.\n2. Participants will have the opportunity to learn from each other through a discussion on how to engage university students in the museum.\n3. Participants will consider how they can reach a diverse range of students in the museum through dialogic techniques, hands-on activities, and other forms of engagement with works of art.\n"
