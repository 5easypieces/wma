This event begins with a brief overview of very specific instructions on how the program works. Chairs are pre-setup across from each other in pairs enabling participants to move from chair to chair in a pre-determined sequence whereby information and business card exchange will occur. These are fun, fast-paced, timed intervals concluding with everyone meeting each other briefly. At the conclusion, mingling will continue.||*Speed Networking has occurred the past three years at the WMA conference as a stand-alone, free, event aligned with the opening evening festivities."

We create a uniquely \"safe\" and fun environment for everyone who enters the space with warm welcomes and humor.
