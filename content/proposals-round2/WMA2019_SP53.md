Join us for this double session for the first time, or return to continue the conversation in Boise.  Discuss what self-care looks like for professionals of color! Develop your skills as a white ally! Find a community of practice! Workshop-style activities and break-out groups prepare participants to be effective advocates for equity and inclusion. "

Update understanding of core concepts related to racial and ethnic inequity in museums and the broader culture.\n*3. Define what being a white ally and responsible gatekeeper looks like, and what self-care for professionals of color requires, in museums. "
engagement = "This session will move from an \"undoing institutional racism 101? overview focused on one key concept, to activities in break-out groups that allow for frank discussion.
