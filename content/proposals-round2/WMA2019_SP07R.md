session_desc = "Most museum leaders have limited experience with capital projects. Yet they find themselves in design and planning meetings making decisions that will impact their institutions for decades. This session will help leaders and staff understand the ramifications of various early decisions such things as cost of operations, staffing, sustainability, revenue generation, and programmatic flexibility, so that they can balance these impacts with the up-front cost of alternative design, mechanical, or material choices."

engagement = "Three museum decision-makers will follow, each having completed a project in the last 10 years, and each will take a formal “look-back” at these decisions and others, and specific lessons learned in the process. A museum construction expert (Bart Shively) will share a brief overview of typical alternative design and mechanical decisions that he encounters in museum projects of all sizes. Bart will compare upfront to long-term operating costs and other impacts of such systems and decisions, lending insights from the cost and client experience side. The facilitator will provoke the audience and museum panel to consider and reconsider how their decisions, which may be cost- or operations-based up front, will impact those costs and operations in the long run, etc…"
