session_title = "Engaging with Place in Exhibits"
session_desc = "How can exhibits encourage visitor engagement with specific places? Case studies from a natural history museum, aquarium, children’s museum, and wilderness park become jumping-off points for discussion of how exhibits connect visitors with their surroundings. Through intentional themes, interactives, materials, and labels, exhibits can give kids and adults opportunities to appreciate, make meaning, and connect with their environment in new and heightened ways. Attendees will discuss dynamics between built and natural, urban and wild."

session_type = "Standard panel (2 or more panelists)"
session_unique = "The powerful medium of exhibits can heighten experiences and build appreciation for environments by encouraging active participation in our exhibits and out in the world."
session_objectives = "Through active discussion and audience input, attendees explore strategies\n  to meaningfully engage visitors with their surroundings using exhibits as vehicles\n  to nurture, foster, and facilitate human connections with particular places. \n  ·       \n  Attendees discuss places\n  exhibits evoke through design and interpretation: spaces immediately at the\n  exhibit location (a wilderness park, an adjacent shoreline, or immediate neighborhood)\n  and places physically or conceptually removed (an area perceived as dangerous\n  or typically inaccessible like underwater, the top of a redwood tree, or a\n  weather event common to a region).\n  ·       \n  Attendees gain new insights about engaging human senses\n  and encouraging active noticing of place by bringing the inside out and the\n  outside in using specific tactics like: material choices, environmental\n  recreations, physical and media interactives, allowing risk taking, and related\n  programming. \n\n  Takeaways include a sample\n  front-end evaluation instrument and a list of programming ideas.\n  ·       \n  Attendees explore ways to engage human senses, invite emotion,\n  evoke memories, aid learning, and allow risk taking at their own sites through\n  examples of projects that successfully\n  connect visitors with what’s in and beyond their backyards, raise awareness\n  about environments, and deepen appreciation for specific places. \n  \n \n\n\n\n\n"
engagement = "In short (5-minute) segments, the moderator and panelists introduce a series of diverse case studies illustrating the role exhibits can play in enhancing visitor understanding, connection, and experience of place. Inviting questions and comments throughout, audience participation allows for lively discussion of ways to nurture a sense place through exhibit elements and themes."
audience = "Museum and interpretive site personnel who develop and design exhibits and/or work with visitors in public spaces."
level = "Any (professions involved in exhibits in any capacity at any sized institution)"

theme_relationship = "Exhibits can tell stories and be developed to increase engagement of surrounding resources and environments—creating a deeper sense of place. This session shares examples of how exhibition themes and interactive elements encourage active noticing. Museums, parks, aquariums, and other informal education centers are in a unique position to mediate transformational learning opportunities providing glimpses into often hidden realms, through prompting the use of human senses, and physically engaging users in the power of place"
