The Museum needed to re-engage a new generation of Nordic-American and non-Nordic audiences.\n*Solution: Engagement of a new generation was increased by creating a modern immersive Nordic experience. The new museum links exhibits and architecture to create a fully immersive and re-branded environment that includes a caf?, store and great hall. Programs and museum elements were reimagined for contemporary audiences?music, travelling shows, films, food and gatherings."
