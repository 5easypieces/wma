This panel is designed to be a very practical exploration of where to obtain funding and financing for bold, new initiatives, where to seek advice for funding and financing, and how to make progress with so much competition for scarce financial resources. This panel will explore case studies of obstacles faced by both large and smaller museums and the solutions used to move bold ideas and projects Forward.

This session is designed to deliver “news you can use” – information that attendees can go back to their museums and implement in order to move Forward with the bold and exciting initiatives and projects emanating from the WMA 2020 Annual Conference. This panel will seek to: • Identify the obstacles • Identify the solutions • Discuss how fundraising, funding and financing all fit together • How to succeed in funding and financing these projects and initiatives. • Where to obtain advice and manage conflicting and competing interests  * How to work with both internal and external financial partners Our session is intended to help all participants in the process of envisioning and delivering capital and programming projects, to come away from the conference with practical advice and tips for how funding and financing can be obtained for important museum projects that are moving Forward."""
