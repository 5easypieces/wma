session_desc = "Professional conservators are essential to collections care, but facing the realities of limited budgets and needy artifacts, when can (or should) museum staff provide some DIY? Throughout the rebuilding of the Idaho State Museum, collaborative partnerships between collections staff and professional conservators opened up new possibilities for both collections stewardship and professional engagement. Join a discussion about the line between “DIY” and “do not touch” to better care for the artifacts that need us!"

session_unique = "As a case study, ISM’s partnerships provide models for collaborative practices of engagement between collections staff and conservators."
session_objectives = "Our primary objective is to encourage collections personnel to form close partnerships with conservators to better care for stewarded artifacts. Additionally, we would like to present strategies that helped our team succeed in maximizing both budgets and staff skills. Like many museums, the ISM only had a particular amount of money set aside for conservation. Our needs exceeded that amount exponentially. After talking to local conservators, the idea that we could in fact, do some of this work in-house was exciting! Most literature suggests a very hands-off approach and leaves much up to professional conservators. Working with Diana and others brought to light just how much we could do, which better allowed us to prioritize those artifacts or injuries we couldn’t tackle independently. Attendees will leave this session with the knowledge of who else in their WMA community has faced conservation conundrums like theirs, what they can do now to mitigate some stabilization needs of artifacts across the spectrum, and a better understanding of when and how to enlist a conservator."
engagement = "Speed networking intro-participants and attendees introduce selves by sharing experiences of “conservation nightmares” and exchanging contact details. Jody describes the framework for collections during ISM remodel and moderates discussion. Sarah and Nicole present short summaries of Owyhee Dome restoration and Textiles Digitization Initiative, bringing in Diana. Diana discusses these relationships from a conservator’s lens. Q&A w/discussion for 10 minutes to close session. Handouts: How to asses an artifact’s conservation needs. What you can do now to stabilize artifacts in your collection (Go, Slow Down, Stop approach to common stabilization needs/when to call a conservator)."

Sarah’s partnership with Cheri was highly productive and in instances of more substantial repair, Cheri stepped in. The process of restoration was one of Sarah’s primary tasks after it was taken off exhibit and was a several years long endeavor. After completion and reinstallation, the dome once again serves as a signature piece in the Idaho State Museum thanks to Sarah and Cheri’s work and stewardship."

During the course of the ISM textile digitization initiative and ISM redesign, her consultation regarding the stabilization and conservation of several delicate pieces, which would not have been digitized or displayed due to their condition, was instrumental. She consulted on specific techniques used, materials, and planned methods of approach for several repairs and assisted in advising how to construct mounts and displays that would support the stabilized pieces."
