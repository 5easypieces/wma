session_desc = "This session focuses on strategies from a specific marketing campaign that can provide a “nuts and bolts” approach to marketing events, exhibits, or programming within a cultural institution. We take a look at the three main cornerstones in a marketing campaign; messaging, media best practices, and laying a solid, cohesive foundation for a campaign through branding. The focus is to organize a marketing work plan into three categories and identify scalable strategies in each category."

session_objectives = "1. Outline three cornerstones in a\n  successful marketing campaign. Attendees with\n  marketing and communications designated to his/her job title will know how to\n  create messaging that is “on brand” across social media, interviews, and\n  advertising. The panel will create understanding in media best practices—writing\n  and sending press releases, as well as maintaining press contacts. Attendees\n  will have an understanding of what makes a strong brand foundation work\n  together to engage all audiences effectively and consistently. We will cover\n  what it means to be “on brand?”  Attendees will receive a press release\n  template as well as an example of an organized media contact spreadsheet.\n   \n   \n  2. Provide strategies in developing\n  a timeline for planning, outreach, and engagement. Timing is a moving target in marketing a campaign. These\n  strategies serve as general guidelines in how to approach the logistics of a\n  campaign.  Attendees will receive\n  a marketing “checklist” template that assists in providing a scalable\n  timeline, showing when major areas of a marketing campaign should be\n  implemented.\n   \n  3. Review best practices when\n  engaging with media. When should you\n  begin conducting media outreach to promote your campaign? How can you engage\n  with media and effectively foster productive relationships? What type of\n  information should be delivered to media? We will\n  clearly answer all these questions related to productive partnerships with\n  media outlets. \n   \n  \n \n\n\n\n\nThese concepts will be\nintroductory to mid-level with regard to content and approach. Little-to-no\nmarketing or communications experience necessary grasp these concepts and apply\nthe strategies. Furthermore, those of a mid-level understanding can take their\nfoundation and build on it using these strategies effectively"
