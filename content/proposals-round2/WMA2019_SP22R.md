This session will focus on a successful partnership between the Idaho State Museum and National History Day. An NHD student, teacher, librarian and professionals who are former NHD students along with the NHD coordinators from Utah and Idaho will discuss lessons learned from developing this partnership, the numerous benefits to the community, and ideas for how other organizations can forge partnerships with education initiatives."

Offer ideas on\n  how to successfully forge partnerships that will help museums engage with\n  schools.\n  3.      Identify and\n  offer ways to foster the connection between education partnerships,\n  historical literacy and informed citizenship in communities. \n  4.      Because National\n  History Day is a local, state, and national program with many community\n  partners across the country, it is able to be a big driver in helping\n  students really see the relevancy of history.\n  5.      The intended\n  audience is for every member of a museum team because every person on a\n  museum team is important to making a partnership meaningful. \n  6.      In this session,\n  every attendee will gain a broader perspective on how education partnerships\n  can benefit their team and concrete ideas for improving already existing\n  partnerships or beginning new ones! This will be supported by a “Guide to\n  Integrating Education Programs into Your Museum” that will include:\n  a.     \n  Field trip plans\n  b.     \n  How to use Archives and Libraries\n  c.     \n  How to justify relevancy to funders/donors/government\n  entities through education initiatives\n  d.     \n  Museum exhibits/collections/programs that support\n  partnerships\n  \n \n\n\n\n\nOnline tools "
