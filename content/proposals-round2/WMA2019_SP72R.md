Tacoma Art Museum tackled this problem head-on with an innovative strategy, hiring and training a diverse group of educators. Understand the value of hiring staff who reflect your community. Learn how transformed hiring practices and intensive training cultivated a corps of capable educators rooted in authentic community engagement. Come away with resources and next steps for your institution."

We intentionally hired educators who reflect our community, especially folks who have been embedded in the community for much of their lives, to better engage students and visitors. We will discuss budgetary implications (including funding priorities) and address potential ways to apply this model to institutions of various sizes and locations."
theme_comments = "We would like to include a presenter from another institution who has a similar\n  model of hiring educators/staff from the community served with less recruiting\n  emphasis on education & experience, and intensive training to support\n  staff development â€“ especially an institution working with First\n  Nations/Indigenous communities. Any help finding such a presenter would be\n  welcomed.\n   \nIf this session would\nbe best merged with another session on diversity in the workforce and/or\ndiverse hiring practices, we would be open to that."
