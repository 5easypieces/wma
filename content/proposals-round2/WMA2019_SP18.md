session_desc = "This session will provide both an overview and a deep dive into best practices for submitting a grant application to the Federal Government. We will focus specifically on the Institute of Museum and Library Services Museums for America program which has an annual deadline in December. In addition to general grant-writing tips, we will share specific tips, timelines, and examples to help make this application process more accessible for all eligible Museums."

session_unique = "Though the IMLS has shared information about grant opportunities at WMA, this session from a grant writer is specifically geared toward tackling this application process."
session_objectives = "1. Learn grant writing basics: participants will understand how to structure a successful grant narrative.\n*2. Understand IMLS Museums for America application elements: participants will have a step-by-step explanation of each element that is required to submit to the federal government when applying for funds as well as how to fill them out.\n*3. Thoughtfully analyze your Museum's strategic direction: participants will understand how to use their Museum's mission and strategic plan to help develop projects where engagement is central.\n*Outcome: Participants will leave with a clear knowledge of how to approach a federal agency when applying for a grant.\n*Outcome: Participants will have access to a successful grant application, as well as their Museum colleague who submitted it, and be able to ask questions based on their own project ideas.\n*Outcome: Participants will be able to leave the session with practical tools to bring back to their Museum and share with colleagues"
engagement = "The session will ideally have two speakers: one from the agency and one from a Museum that has been awarded multiple grants from the agency. In addition to a powerpoint presentation, there will be brief in-session writing exercises, explanatory handouts, and group conversations. There will be time for participants to share experiences with one another, as well as to ask questions of the speakers."

Many of the federal agency's guidelines require this kind of engagement for successful applications. This session will help people think about their projects in a logical, strategic way so that they can write about them clearly and submit an application that is competitive for federal money."
