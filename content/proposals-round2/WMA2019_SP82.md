session_desc = "That some visitors feel sidelined or undermined by museums is no laughing matter. Or is it? Camp can be their means to send us up wherever they feel we are seriously missing out. Once introduced to camp methods—grounded in but moving beyond queer theory, participants will be guided through a museum by local drag queens and diverse youth, “camp counselors” modeling how to discover fresh, inclusive insights by “camping up” the museum experience. Alternative Description:\n\nThis session offers a low-cost approach for making the museum experience more appealing to audiences who may feel unacknowledged or otherwise alienated.  Using camp, an aesthetic that has ties to queer theory, we will demonstrate how “camping up” the museum experience can lead to new ways of interpreting and connecting to exhibits. With local drag queens and LGBTQ youth acting as “camp counselors,” participants will then visit a museum to try on this approach."

session_objectives = "1) To welcome the LGBTQ\ncommunity and persons in their teens to their twenties— groups not always\nwell-reached by museums. Camp can be appropriated, however, by any kind of\nvisitor who feels sidelined, undermined, or left out, providing them a fun,\nconstructive way to address and redress exhibits and interpretations they would\nlike to see changed. Visitors can thus use camp to turn the possible negatives of\nolder standing exhibitions into sites of spontaneous, sharply witty feedback,\ninformation museums can use for future programming, exhibition planning, and\ncommunity outreach. \n\n2) To offer any audience\nmember a humorous way to interact with the museum that can demystify and\nde-serious what may be perceived as an intimidating authority. We will look at\nvarious ways to share these insights that will drive more visitors to the\nmuseum: on the website where people can post blogs, vlogs or selfies where they\nhave “camped out” in a museum; or on-site visits through fun, campy\nprogramming.  (Every year the De Young\nMuseum of San Francisco invites floral artists to do arrangements in front of\nart works that reflect on and interpret them. Why not a “Camping” festival?)\n\n3)\nTo encourage museum professionals not to take themselves and their work too\nseriously, while taking seriously visitor feedback that otherwise might be\ndifficult to receive. Laughter does wonders to take the edge off, even if the wit is edgy. Camp can thus allow for more open empathy and enjoyment of diverse audience reactions and experiences."

Local “camp counselors” will then demonstrate how to camp up at a local museum—poking fun with a purpose to reveal deeper insights missed by the museum. Participants will try their hand at camping out, and share take-aways. We hope later to reconvene with a drag show and cocktail soirée at a local bar, that can serve as a dual fundraiser for the WMA and a local charity chosen by the camp counselors."
