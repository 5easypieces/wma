session_desc = "To deepen Idahoans’ connection to their state and build a statewide sense of community and create an essential resource for education and lifelong learning, the new Idaho State Museum in Boise was designed for purposeful impact. This session explores the engagement and evaluation practice and tactics used to ensure the museum achieved statewide resonance and to deploy data to make decisions and demonstrate results."

session_objectives = "The Idaho State Historical Society (ISHS) created history on October 12, 2018, with the opening of the newly reimagined, Idaho State Museum. \n *To create a purposeful and measurable visitor experience and shape relevant and impactful exhibition content, ISHS created an inclusive system of community engagement, including focus groups, electronic surveys, workshops, small group meetings, an ongoing partnership with Idaho’s five federally recognized tribes, an Educator  Advisory Council, and collaborative with 70 university academics and local scholars across Idaho. Wherever possible, ISHS connected stories from Idaho’s past to the present, providing vital context to the interpretation. And, ISHS integrated Idaho’s cultural diversity throughout the exhibition experience.  A statewide formal storyline testing process through focus groups was conducted between the schematic design and design development exhibition phases and final design was changed to reflect audience interests.  Upon opening, ISHS launched a follow-up study to measure visitor experience and impact. This process provides data upon which we are responding to enhance the visitor experience and expand our impact. \n  \nSession participants will: Understand a range of methods in engaging a statewide audience in museum development and how that engagement influences decisions about audience experience, including exhibition design and builds constituency, including tribal and under-represented communities \n\nUnderstand the role and practice of an assessment consultant and pre and post assessment/evaluation methods\n\nUnderstand how to mine and use study data to inform museum operations, help to prioritize new program development, or target promotional or marketing efforts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Resources and takeaways will include power-point, survey methods, survey analysis and interpretation, and visual examples of social media results per deploying data to respond to customer need.

To express it in the simplest of terms, it comes down to doing the right thing; which entails vision, a commitment to community engagement, and a philosophy of interpreting history in a manner that is relevant to today; and then doing it right; executing at the highest possible level of professional practice and process discipline.  The practice of community engagement is a cornerstone in our work. "
