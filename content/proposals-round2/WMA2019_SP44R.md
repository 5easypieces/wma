Participants will: · Learn about 3 national initiatives that support capacity-building around diversity/inclusion/equity/access; · Understand how they can access these and other resources and professional development models; and · Take home diversity/inclusion resources, inspiration, and concrete ideas to make change within their institutions From the first activity, the Diversity Wheel, which expands participants' thinking about definitions of diversity and can be replicated in their home institutions, to presentations and follow-up discussions with panel members from each of the three national initiatives, participants will thoughtfully consider where they as individuals and their institutions are on their inclusion journeys. Handouts, including ways to access various resources in the field, will ensure that participants feel they have tools to take the next step in helping their institutions to consider organizational change around DEAI issues. Eachof the three initiatives presented incorporates strong participatory engagementas a cornerstone of this important work, and dialogue is a critical element ofthe engagement. Through this workshop, participants can expect to engage inrich conversations, be inspired by new ideas, and gain access to field-wideresources focused on diversity/inclusion/equity and access. "
