session_desc = "Museums across the country are breaking down silos between the sciences, arts, and humanities to create interdisciplinary experiences that help visitors understand our complex world. This session’s project team - consisting of an art museum, a living history museum, and a science center - has been taking these efforts one step further by connecting with content experts from outside our museums’ core disciplines and highlighting them at interdisciplinary public programs. These artists, scientists, and historians illuminate the real work they do, humanize their professions, and help make connections between seemingly disparate fields"
