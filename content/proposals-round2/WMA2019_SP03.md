session_desc = "The exhibits industry has been traditionally dominated by men. Women in this field have unique challenges - and opportunities - for career development and advancement. How do women avoid marginalization to find motivation and support? This facilitated dialogue will provide descriptions of real-life situations, explore possible solutions and strategies, and provide resources for networking. If you attended last year's session, please join us and share your gained knowledge. All museum departments are welcome."

session_unique = " Few sessions focus on creating a supportive environment to discuss women’s work-related issues.  There are fewer that offer this in a small group discussion setting. "
session_objectives = "1.)\tDiscuss/share issues of the profession and practical solutions for overcoming obstacles.\n2.)\tHave a facilitated conversation between panelists and audience members about breaking down barriers in the industry while providing resources for networking and development.\n3.)\tFor participants to become bigger, bolder, better versions of themselves.\n"
engagement = "During this session, participants will join in small group discussions that include answering pre-determined questions and hearing real life scenarios.  After a series of exercises, participants will develop a list of strategies.  The goal of these discussions is for participants to feel heard and empowered with the knowledge that they have gained.  Post-session resources will be provided."

theme_relationship = "Last year we INSPIRED women to swap work stories, share resources, discuss issues and possible solutions. In addition, this year we will ENGAGE them with real-life work scenarios with an emphasis on practical solutions, including ways to effect change – both internal & external. This format creates a safe space for conversation through small group discussion in which confidentiality will be respected.   "
theme_comments = "1. Depending on anticipated attendance, we may need assistance securing additional women interested in being small group discussion leaders who are also committed to attending the session. I have a list of leaders I would like to ask, but I suspect there may be last minute drop-outs. FYI - In 2018, we had 65 attendees, with 5 small group discussion leaders (not including myself). Ideally, we limit the small group numbers to 12/group. \n2. Is there the possibility of sending out a questionnaire that solicits input from those interested in our session – especially those who cannot attend Boise?  Ideally,\nwe would send them questions to answer & ask them to share work-related\nexamples of hitting the Plexi ceiling and how they handled it.    I understand you have suggested the below resources to find presenters, but would these be appropriate for posting a questionnaire?  If so, which would you suggest to be the most appropriate?   posting to the WMA LinkedIn Group, our dedicated Facebook discussion post, as well as reaching out on professional listservs such as RCAAM, Museum-Ed, or Museum-L.posting to the WMA LinkedIn Group, our dedicated Facebook discussion post, as well as reaching out on professional listservs such as RCAAM, Museum-Ed, or Museum-L.\n\n\n\n"
