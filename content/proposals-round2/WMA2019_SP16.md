session_title = "Academic Museums: Interdisciplinary Collaboration in Object-based Learning"
session_desc = "The academic museum has an opportunity to create a model for all museums to provide new and meaningful learning experiences for students, faculty, and the diverse communities they serve. This session includes presentations by three speakers from academic museums opening collections spaces in innovative and unconventional ways. Through interdisciplinary partnerships, new ways of thinking and interpretation ultimately enrich higher education and integrate a museum into student life, faculty teaching practices, and transfers to communities beyond campus borders."
session_track = ""
session_unique = "Unconventional access and collaboration encourage academic museums to shift to a community-driven hub and provides a model for all types of museums. The session's moderator will talk about how these academic examples can translate to non-academic museums."
session_objectives = "1. Gaining the knowledge needed to start opening a museum's collection to non-traditional partners\n*2. Looking at three to four case studies of museums practicing extraordinary collections access successfully\n*3. To learn more about unconventional partnerships that your museum hasn?t thought about yet (how to look for connections through your collections)"
engagement = "1. 10 minutes: Introduction of topic and structure of session by a moderator.\n*2. 15 minutes each (for 3 speakers): Participating speakers will detail their museum's unique collections access, give a few examples of successful collections partnerships, and \n*3. 10 minutes: Conclusion and list of takeaways by moderator\n*4. 10 minutes: question and answer period from the audience"
audience = "Education, Collections Management, Programming, Public Outreach, and Curatorial professionals"
level = "all levels"
other_comments = "This is a valuable session with relevant takeaways to empower professionals from any of the above areas to return to their individual museums and start prototyping a multifaceted collections access program"
theme_relationship = "This session may touch upon the following themes of the conference:  Unconventional and innovative partnerships, Museums as inclusive places, Museums as agents of social change / social justice, Storytelling to engage new audiences, Activism in museums"
theme_comments = "I do need help in finding presenters. I have a large list of academic museums that would be suitable to speak due to the fact that my thesis deals specifically with academic museums. My list is art museum-heavy and it is possible that I will have further options once I conduct more interviews for my thesis this coming January.  I would be willing to merge with another session if it makes sense.\n*Other speaker suggestions:\n*1. Minetti Shrem Museum at UC Davis - contact would be Jennifer Wagelie  jjwagelie@ucdavis.edu \n*2. SFMOMA - (non-academic) Artist Initiative: Curatorial, Conservation, and Education Department collaboration - Robin Clark, Director rclark@sfmoma.org \n*a. If the above speaker was included, I would also include CSU East Bay - Professor Jason Smith - he would be presenting on how SFMOMA has helped develop a collaborative approach to students viewing art to enrich their medical humanities education"
