session_desc = "Since 1980, the chance of major floods, hurricanes, wild fires or other severe weather events has increased by 300%. This session introduces resilient design and provides tools and applications for small to large museums to identify and reduce risk. Attendees will participate in a hands-on workshop utilizing a planning tool to assess, prioritize and plan for resiliency. This session is a companion to session #34."

session_objectives = "1. Attendees will learn how resiliency planning can help reduce risks associated with severe weather events, as well as infrastructure, security, local pollution and other issues that may impact institutions. Resiliency planning is a process of forecasting risks, assessing likelihood and impact, and planning to mitigate those risks. This session introduces the resilient planning process and how it might apply to museums of all sizes.\n\n2. Attendees will learn about practical applications to mitigate climate change based on a case study. The Science Museum of Minnesota has had great success in cutting their contributions to carbon dioxide pollution by more than 30 percent in just four years as well as reducing heating and cooling costs by 38 percent. Attendees will learn how the museum has embraced their environmental responsibility and is sharing their success story to help others.\n\n3. Attendees will take away a customizable planning tool for resiliency planning. This session will share resources and a planning tool that can help museums of all sizes identify and prepare for potentially catastrophic events. Embedding resiliency planning will benefit existing institutions, as well as those planning for renovation of new facility.\n\nThis session will coordinate with session #34 Museums and Climate Change: Defining a Sustainable Path Forward. Content will be unique and supportive for each session, yet able to stand on their own.\n"
engagement = "The session will begin with a presentation introducing resiliency planning and the increased risk posed by a changing climate. A case study will be presented based on the Science Museum of Minnesota's success in cutting carbon emissions and focusing on practical solutions to mitigating risks. A resiliency planning tool will be introduced and will involve hands-on break-out session (ideally at round tables in the room), followed by a share-out and wrap-up at the end."
