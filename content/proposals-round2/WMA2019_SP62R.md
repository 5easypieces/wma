session_desc = "Many American Indian\n  objects displayed in museums are exhibited for their aesthetic qualities\n  without taking into consideration their cultural context.  The staff at the American Indian Cultural\n  Center & Museum is developing an exhibition that not only takes into\n  consideration the cultural context of objects but presents their stories as\n  beings that are imbued with a living spirit. \n  Session will explore the way in which tribes and the community voice\n  express cultural contrast in giving voice to our precious objects.\n   \n  Exhibit\n  Description:  Description: Featuring objects from the\n  Smithsonian’s National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) collection that\n  represent the thirty-nine American Indian communities located in Oklahoma, Life of an Object examines the relationship between tribal people and\n  the objects made as an expression of their cultural paradigm. Located in the\n  Mezzanine Gallery, Life of\n  an Object will be a 10-year signature exhibition within the inaugural plan\n  for the American Indian Cultural Center & Museum (AICCM). Opening in Spring\n  2021, this installation of diverse materials that have been selected to\n  provide tribal equity, support the curatorial concept, and include rotations\n  planned to address best practices for the objects’ conservation.\n   \n  Organized within three major themes, the objects\n  will reveal to the viewer their role as an extension of the tribal\n  communities, speaking to the relationships that exist with the people who\n  hold them. Labels will be prepared giving “voice” to the objects, prepared by\n  curatorial staff in consultation with tribal members:\n   \n  • Creation will explore the\n  customary practices related to making objects through the practices and\n  materials, the unique tribal aesthetic systems, and the bonds that are built\n  as part of the object’s making.\n\n• Collecting will examine what happens\nto an object once placed in the hands of a collector and, later, within\ninstitutional collections, including consideration for who collects, who sells,\nand what is effected through the process of formal collection (shifts in values, historic preservation, and market-driven construction).\n• Continuum celebrates how objects help people to remember their history, mark their place within cultural cosmology, and sing into the future.\n\nThis gallery will be a celebration of the objects, their stories, and their roles within the culture. Through tribal consultations, the AICCM staff endeavor to create original research on the objects. For each label, objects will be identified through Indigenous language terms, setting a priori for their cultural identities. Each tribe will be represented by 3-4 objects and with at least one extended label. Additional consultations will address confirmation for appropriate use of the object within the exhibition and to confirm tribal preferences for conservation decisions.\n\nA few selected objects have been identified for an additional media treatment to create a “Reunion,” resulting from collection notes that provide enough information to identify ancestors for whom living family members are known within the tribal communities. We anticipate creating special media treatments that account for these reunions, possibly including family contacts at the NMAI Cultural Resources Center and in Oklahoma at the AICCM.\n\nMany of these objects have never been exhibited within the context of their tribal relationships or in Oklahoma, near their tribal family. The AICCM anticipates that the accessibility of the objects will be a conduit to the regeneration of historic practices and linguistic terms and will provide an opportunity for intratribal and intertribal cultural exchange in relationship to the materials and techniques used in the making of the objects. Curators have already begun the work to explore the terms that are located in the historic collection notes that are no longer used within tribal linguistic practices. The potentially powerful effect of having these objects in relationship to their cultural people has only begun.\n\nThis exhibition will contribute to existing scholarship in a multitude of impacts. Many of the objects have minimal information documented, particularly beyond the initial collection notes. The consultations with the tribes have the potential of providing a deeper understanding of the objects.\nThe AICCM Curatorial Department has adopted a formal Research Protocol that will support the center’s research team to work with best practices currently available within Indigenous Methodologies. The research will be multi-sited and multi-cultural, assert priority levels of agency for tribal engagement that protect the community collaborators, and integrate the tribally-set priorities within the reciprocal research model. Research resulting from this project will be shared in return with tribal members and the NMAI for continued use and development. Prioritizing culturally-guided core tenets, the research methodology used by the AICCM staff will seek to implement:\n• Respect (for people, knowledge, aesthetics),\n• Reciprocity (as practice in all levels of our work),\n• Relationships (building kincentricity with our community and objects), and\n• Responsibility (to tribal knowledge, community members, and donors/supporters).\n\nWe are drawing inspiration and guidance from the wisdom of our ancestors to create exhibition concepts that celebrate our history and forge a path for our future through innovative and exploratory curatorial practices.\n\n"
