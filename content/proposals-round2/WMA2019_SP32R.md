session_title = "Not for Sale: Preserving and Sharing a Community Collection"
session_desc = "This session explores interactions amongst various stakeholders with a contested collection related to the incarceration of Japanese Americans during WWII. In 2015, a grassroots protest halted the auction that included artwork and crafts collected from camp inmates by writer/curator Allen Hendershott Eaton. The emotional protest and acquisition by a single community based museum raises questions about authority, community accountability, and provenance. Panelists share their roles in the collection’s disposition, collaborations, and interpretation of objects."

session_unique = "This contested auction of Japanese American artifacts raises questions about authority, community accountability, provenance, commodification of history, and marginalized histories, and cultural representation."
session_objectives = "From its initial collection by Allen\nHendershott Eaton for his book Beauty\nBehind Barbed Wire, to the eventual 2015 public auction and community\nprotest, this collection of Japanese American artifacts made in camp are an\nexample of how individuals and organizations can work together in shaping\nhistory for themselves and their community. The Museum now oversees the\ncollection and has begun the long process of trying to identify items by\ntraveling pop-up displays across the nation where critical masses of Japanese\nAmericans still reside. By sharing this story, our objectives are two fold for\nthe double session: \n\n1) In the first half, participants will acquire\npractical knowledge of the role individuals and communities have in informing\nthe functions of Museums and institutions in relation to cultural/historical\npreservation. The story of the auction, protest, subsequent cancellation, and\nformation of the All Camp Consortium will be covered here. \n\n2) In the second half, participants will consider how\nMuseums negotiate and reconcile curatorial practice, collections management,\nand institutional by-laws with community needs and access. We will present case studies illustrating the challenges, resolutions, and opportunities that arise with this work. This includes the development of the Minidoka interpretive center in Idaho by the NPS and the Contested Histories pop-up that will have visited non-traditional sites as well as NARA in Washington DC (This includes videos revealing behind the scenes work). We will close with a participatory discussion on how institutions can identify and develop deep connections with relevant communities, partners, and donors."
engagement = "Panelists will present their distinct vantage points in relation to this grassroots protest. We seek the opportunity for exchange and discussion with colleagues from other institutions, to present for consideration the Eaton collection and its unique disposition into a broader discussion about preservation protocol, the implications of objects related to community history or cultural heritage, provenance and ownership of cultural history/heritage objects, connoisseurship, post-custodial collection strategies, and collaborative curation."
audience = "Museum professionals, historians, curators, collections, education, and others who hope to engage communities in their work."

theme_relationship = "This controversial public auction of the Eaton collection brought about a grass roots effort engaging individuals and organizations to unite to stop this sale. In doing so, it illustrated the power we have when we work together. The All Camp Consortium, which represents many of these groups, is now working closer and sharing resources and lobbying government ensuring long lasting relationships and a unified voice moving forward."
theme_comments = "We are set with our presenters. We feel that a double session is necessary to cover the unique aspects of this project including the legal aspects and the use of social media that created an incredible ground swell of support. We also feel that the process of engaging community with the pop-up is a unique example that many will be interested in seeing and connecting to the work that they do. We would still be open to doing a single session and could also do this as two single sessions as well."
