When these objects are acquired through loan, purchase, or donation they can make the museum exhibition more engaging to visitors."
theme_comments = "Yes I will need help finding presenters. I am willing to moderate, but open to having \n*another fellow museum professional do so. I think three people is a great number to have up there. I think two presenters and a moderator ideal.\n*Yes I am willing to merge with another session if necessary; however, I believe this topic stands alone and there are a lot of different experiences that curators can share regarding it.
