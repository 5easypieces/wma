session_title = "Engaging with Place in Exhibits"
session_desc = "How can exhibits encourage engagement with place? This discussion-based session will share case studies of physical exhibits designed to connect visitors with their surroundings. \"Place\"Placeincludes both natural and built environments, often leveraging areas where urban and wild meet and overlap. Attention will be given to labels and interactives that offer adults and kids opportunities to use their senses and encourage them to actively notice their environment in new and heightened ways."
session_track = ""
session_unique = "The powerful medium of exhibits can help people attach more meaning and heighten experiences of places by encouraging active noticing of the world around them."
session_objectives = "Attendees will explore strategies that meaningfully engage visitors with their surroundings. We will discuss example projects across institutions of different sizes and that use physical exhibits as vehicles to nurture human connections with particular places. \n*Session Objectives:||* Gain new insights from museum professionals working to bring the inside out and the outside in to engage the human senses and encourage active noticing of place. Join a network of museum professionals working to help visitors connect with what's in and beyond their backyards.||* Explore and share ways to leverage the power of exhibits to enhance visitors' understanding of place. Discuss concrete examples of projects that focus on connecting visitors to spaces immediately at the exhibit location?like a wilderness park, historic site, or neighborhood?and places physically or conceptually a bit removed?a more distant landscape or one typically inaccessible like underwater, a historical version of a place, or a weather event common to a region.||* Identify best practices in exhibition development and design to engage the senses, emotion, and memory that aid in learning. Consider how experiential exhibits play a role in the larger world of placemaking. Discuss the challenge of access and reaching new audiences. Learn about the challenges and success of creating engaging exhibit experiences that leverage sense of place and raise awareness about /deepen appreciation for specific environments. Think about ways to leverage museum collections and programs to cultivate a sense of wonder and stimulate curiosity about the world."
engagement = "The moderator and panelists will introduce the role exhibits play in nurturing a sense place and take turns describing elements of specific exhibit projects that aim to enhance visitors' understanding and connection to place. The audience will take part in the discussion throughout and contribute their own examples. \n*Examples include a science museum, aquarium, children's museum, and wilderness park."
audience = "Museum and interpretive site personnel who develop and design exhibits and/or work with visitors in public spaces."
level = "Any (professions involved in exhibits in any capacity at any sized institution)"
other_comments = "Although this focuses on physical exhibits, people who do interpretive programming may also be interested."
theme_relationship = "Exhibits can tell stories and be designed to increase engagement of surrounding resources and environments?creating a deeper sense of place. This session shares examples of how exhibition themes and interactive elements encourage active noticing. Museums, parks, aquariums, and other informal education centers are in a unique position to mediate transformational learning opportunities providing glimpses into often hidden realms, through prompting the use of human senses, and physically engaging users in the power of place."
theme_comments = "We have an additional potential presenter lined up: Lila Higgins, Senior Manager of Community Science, at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. She could discuss Nature Lab, where visitors explore objects and hands-on elements that increase public awareness of nature in cities and mediate a deeper appreciation of urban ecosystems. Encouraging active noticing connects people to what's in their backyards, including how their observations become data points for science. The community/citizen science data help land managers and urban planners make decisions that work better for human wellbeing and wildlife. Lila is not travelling due to the climate crisis and could participate remotely/virtually.\n*Please review the presenter information below and consider whether Lila could participate.\n*Also, Beth's current firm was involved in the design of the project Patty will present; Beth wasn?t employed at the firm at that time and the connection is tangential to the session.\n*We would be willing to merge with another session or change the format.
