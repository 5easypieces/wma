session_title = "Planned Giving Opportunities with the Upcoming Transfer of Wealth"
session_desc = "Studies show that $9 trillion in assets will be passed in the U.S. from Baby Boomers to Gen X and millennials by 2027. It is imperative that fundraisers plan thoughtfully for this transfer of wealth because great opportunity exists to secure planned gifts. While many nonprofits focus on immediate funding needs, Museums are in a unique position, responsible for long-term institutional preservation and collections care. It is not only prudent, but necessary to develop sustainable revenue."

session_type = "Standard panel (2 or more panelists) "
session_unique = "To give perspective, according to Chronicle of Philanthropy if nonprofits secure just 5% of this wealth it would be the equivalent of 10 Gates Foundations."
session_objectives = "Objectives:\n  ·       \n  To inform Museum leaders about the transfer of wealth\n  that will occur in the next decade and how those assets are currently held\n  ·       \n  To describe various types of planned gifts and the\n  potential tax benefits to both donors and their heirs\n  ·       \n  To share simple strategies to implement a planned giving\n  program\n  Outcomes:\n  ·       \n  Attendees will see value in preparing for and investing\n  in long-term fundraising strategies\n  ·       \n  Participants will have an increased understanding of\n  planned giving\n  \n Leaders will be equipped with practical tools\nthat will help them create sustainable revenue"
engagement = "This would be a panel with an estate\n  planner to describe gift types and tax benefits, a staff person from the\n  Idaho Community Foundation to discuss endowment and a colleague with a\n  successful planned giving program.  I\n  would offer strategies on identifying prospects, marketing and stewardship.\n   \n  Takeaways would include definitions,\n  sample policies/materials, suggested readings and professional development\n  opportunities.\n   \n  There would be Q & A and with discussion on\nsuccesses and challenges that others have faced."
audience = "Museum executives, fundraisers and board members. It may be particularly beneficial for smaller organizations that don’t have planned giving programs."
level = "Senior and supportive staff tied to development"

theme_relationship = "This panel will engage experts across sectors, furthering mission\n  fulfillment.  \n   \nBecause the best\nprospects for planned gifts are not necessarily major donors, it will encourage\nfundraisers to deeply engage long-time members who may not otherwise receive\nthe attention they deserve.  It will help\ninstitutions build strong relationships that can span generations.  This is important because by 2067, the\ntransfer of wealth is expected to be $97 trillion, which could result in\ntransformational gifts for museums."
