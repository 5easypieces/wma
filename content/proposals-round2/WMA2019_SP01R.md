Learn how an art museum, living history museum, and science center expanded upon these efforts by connecting with content experts from outside their core disciplines and highlighting them at interdisciplinary programs. This project, part of Portal to the Public's 3-year research study, developed a flexible framework adaptable for smaller or larger museums."

Identify public program opportunities at their own institutions that can be enhanced by cross-disciplinary content experts."
