From strategies to improve the environmental performance of facilities, to making a difference globally through programs such as We Are Still In, this session will explore the issues surrounding climate change and provide insights on how museums of all varieties can contribute to bringing positive change to their organizations and communities through interpretation and demonstration.  This session is a companion to session #35."

session_objectives = "*1) Take Action – Interpreting Climate Change\n•\tUnderstand how we have played a role in the causes of climate change and how we can play a role in solving these problems.\n•\tExplore how museums can interpret complex scientific issues when many of the most powerful stories of climate change are happening in remote or inaccessible places.  How does these impacts effect a museum’s local community?\n•\tIn an era of misinformation, museums are the best-equipped organizations to share these messages and can leverage their status as trustworthy sources of information to communicate these issues to their audiences and local communities.\n\n*2) Take Action – Improving your Environmental Footprint\n•\tLearn how your museum can serve as an example of positive change within their communities through demonstrations of sustainable design and programming.\n•\tUnderstand the impact your own facility and programs have on the environment and how any negative effects can be mitigated.\n•\tExplore different strategies to improve the performance of all buildings and sites – from new construction to renovations to existing facilities while minimizing operational costs.\n\n*3) Take Action – Inspiring Others\n•\tMuseums must align the abilities, resources, and influence of our sector, with the work and resources of other sectors, to help our communities understand their connection to environment and climate, and to prepare for a changing climate. \n•\tMuseums can use education, research, and communication to foster individual, collaborative and collective action, from every sector, to pursue an inclusive agenda for significant environment and climate impact.\n\nThis session will coordinate with session #35 Museums and Resiliency: Preparing to Preserve and Protect in an Unknown Future. Content will be unique and supportive for each session, yet able to stand on their own.\n"
engagement = "The session will feature presentations on a variety of issues surrounding climate change and how museums can take action to mitigate the impacts of climate change, interpret these complex issues, and inspire their audience to take action. There will be resources and take-aways for all levels of museum professionals, including practical strategies to implement and big picture ideas to inspire change within their organizations and communities. There will be ample time for Q&A."

other_comments = "Ideally, Session #34 would be scheduled first, followed by Session #35 on the same day.  They don’t need to be scheduled back-to-back.  The information in each session will complement the other, giving the audience the opportunity to attend both for a 'deep dive' on the subject or pick and choose based on their specific interests."
theme_relationship = "In order to inspire meaningful change in our collective environmental practices, it will take a collective effort on everyone’s part to make a difference.  This session will help museum professionals understand how they can ENGAGE their audience on these issues, as well as improve the environmental performance of their own facilities."
theme_comments = "We propose pairing this session with #35, as the subject matter complements each other very well.  These would ideally be scheduled in a back-to-back format for maximum educational benefit, or each could stand alone.  The presenters in both sessions will coordinate materials to ensure the complementary nature of the sessions while avoiding duplicate content."
