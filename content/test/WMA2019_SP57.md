session_desc = "A growing trend in the world of small museums is to hire individuals who are not necessarily from a museum background. For these institutions, it is the ability to multi task across disciplines and to possess \"soft skills' that create an ideal candidate. This session will explore the skills brought to the table by these non-traditional hires and how to support their growth as emerging museum professionals. "

engagement = "Presenters speak for about 10 to 15 minutes each and then time for attendees to discuss how they have bridged the gap from non-museum professional to an emerging museum professional, advice they would give to those applying for museum jobs from a non-professional background or what museums should look for in resumes or ask in the interviewing process that would give further insight (beyond education) into the individual's ability to carry out the job.
