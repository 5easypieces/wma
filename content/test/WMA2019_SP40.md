session_title = "Old Shoes and New Tech: Crafting a Mutually Beneficial Museum-University Project"
session_desc = "What happens when you bring together a collection of women's shoes, a history class about women in the U.S. West filled with students from several disciplines, a makerspace, and digital technologies' Maker and curatorial magic! Come learn how a partnership among curatorial and registration staff, a history professor, a librarian, and an instructional designer increased students' understanding of women's history, led them to think of themselves as makers, and resulted in interesting interpretations of an overlooked collection."
session_unique = "Because this partnership focused on using historical artifacts to increase both students' understanding of the past and their digital savvy, museum staff gained both pedagogical and technological insights."
session_objectives = "By the end of the session, participants will:||- learn how one high-impact, low-cost case study was organized and assessed.||- consider how best to structure similar, sustainable projects in their institutional contexts in ways that benefit all participants.||- identify benefits and potential pitfalls in working with students, faculty, and others on a university timeline."
engagement = "After we briefly summarize the goals of the collaboration, outline our process, and share some student work, we will walk participants through active learning and discussion that will help them develop their own productive collaborations. We will employ several different brief activities (e.g., carousel, think-pair-square-share, gallery walk, large- or small-group discussion) to push participants to think creatively about potentially high-impact partnerships."
audience = "Collections, curatorial, and education staff; university faculty"
level = "All, but probably especially useful for mid-career and higher"
