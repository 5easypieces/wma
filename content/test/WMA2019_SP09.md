session_desc = "Join a discussion of the successes and challenges of working with university students who engage with the University of Arizona Museum of Art through their courses. Learn about approaches that allow students to make connections through dialogue, art-making, and object-based learning plus examples of strategies, tours, and projects for single-class visits and semester-long courses. How might we make art museum experiences inspirational and accessible for the diverse community of learners on college campuses?"
session_unique = "We will focus on engaging diverse student populations and offer interactive techniques for working with university students visiting art museums as part of classes."
session_objectives = "Many university students are first-time museum visitors and represent a huge range of personal backgrounds, learning styles, and academic and career interests. This session will consider how museums can best work with the diverse range of university students who visit the museum through courses and class visits, including art and non-art subject areas. We will explore how museum staff and faculty can pave the way for students to make new connections to the content in their courses, consider personal connections to works of art, share and build ideas and interpretations together through dialogue, and make the museum an active learning environment. Examples will range from a semester-long museum education course that met and led tours in the museum to materials developed to engage students as they explore the museum on their own or with peers.\nOutcomes:\n1. Participants will leave with specific ideas on ways they may engage\n university students at the museum through university courses and campus connections.\n2. Participants will have the opportunity to learn from each other through a discussion on how to engage university students in the museum.\n3. Participants will consider how they can reach a diverse range of students in the museum through dialogic techniques, hands-on activities, and other forms of engagement with works of art.\n"
