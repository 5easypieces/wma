session_desc = "Everyone learns from their museum visit, but exactly what and how they learn differ and are tied to variables such as prior knowledge of the content. In this session, we want to share the results of a research study on school groups’ learning and memory, show different ways to cater learning experiences for different audiences (ex: homeschool groups), and facilitate a brainstorming session for how you can further engage visitors with your exhibits."
session_unique = "Research I completed reveals a correlation between learning outcomes and level of prior knowledge. (Spoiler: little/no prior knowledge yields more affective learning outcomes)"
session_objectives = "- Understand the different ways students will respond to, learn from, and engage with your exhibits, depending on variables such as prior knowledge, level of interest, presence of educational supplements.\n- See examples of how to engage with educators before, during, and after their visit to ensure everyone’s educational needs are met, and feedback museums can use for the future.\n- Facilitate useful brainstorming and sharing for attendees to think about how they can refine, modify, or engage in new practices to engage their audiences."
engagement = "Ideally, we would have a panel of three presenters briefly share their research/strategy/case study then provide some time for a Q&A about those presentations. After those specific illustrations, we’d like to then facilitate a small-group conversation among the participants with a series of questions. Wrapping our session to a close, some can share takeaways or make a commitment to at least one small step they can take back to their institution."
audience = "This session is best suited for educators, although curators and marketers may also be served by attending."

theme_relationship = "Engagement is the backbone of our session. It’s about authentically engaging with visitors to understand why they are coming and what they hope to get out of their visit. Knowing that, catering programming, educational supplements, etc. to align with their motivations and interests to ensure their engagement during the museum visit. Ultimately, it’s about how to ensure your offerings engage visitors of all types—regardless of why they’re there or who they’re there with."
theme_comments = "We would like to have one more presenter, and are open to your suggestions. We are also willing to merge with another session, if you see a good fit for us!"
