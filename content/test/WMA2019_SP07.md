session_desc = "Most museum leaders have limited experience with capital design and construction projects, yet in a capital project find themselves in design and planning meetings where they are making decisions that will impact the institution for decades. This session will help leaders and facility managers understand the ramifications of some key decisions on things like cost of operation, staffing, sustainability, revenue generation, and programmatic flexibility, so that they can balance these impacts with the up-front cost of alternative design, mechanical, or material choices."
session_unique = "Past capital planning sessions have generally focused on design for aesthetics or cost, or as far as they have impacted visitorship. This session will give attendees practical decision-making insights that touch bottom line and institutional mission."
session_objectives = "1) Help attendees understand upfront cost vs. ongoing operational cost implications of things like i.e.: MEP systems, layout vis a vis staffing requirements, etc…so that they know what questions to ask.\n 2) Design decisions that affect curatorial and exhibition flexibility (i.e. types of exhibitions, ability to host traveling exhibitions, etc…)\n 3) Design decisions that may affect revenue generation opportunities (i.e. flexible space and/or event-friendly space, cost of including items like prep kitchens vs. revenue upside, etc…)"
engagement = "Three museum decision-makers will follow, each having completed a project in the last 5 years, and each will take a formal “look-back” at these decisions and others, and specific lessons learned in the process. A museum construction expert (Bart Shively) will share a brief overview of typical alternative design and mechanical decisions that he encounters in museum projects of all sizes. Bart will compare upfront to long-term operating costs and other impacts of such systems and decisions, lending insights from the cost and client experience side. The facilitator will provoke the audience and museum panel to consider and reconsider how their decisions, which may be cost- or operations-based up front, will impact those costs and operations in the long run, etc…"

theme_relationship = "Part of the advice that will be discussed will be a directive and method of engaging the entire institution across the diversity of departments when making these design decisions, understanding that each decision has long-term ramifications on every department and person on staff."
theme_comments = "We’re having no problem finding panelists, just the time for the conversations. The final presenter (not yet confirmed) will either be from the Petersen Automotive Museum or the Exploratorium, both of whom are at least a couple of years post-renovation. NHMU has collected “If I did it again” recommendations for the last 20 years from directors who have opened new facilities, which they used heavily throughout planning, design, construction, and opening phases—we will combine that w/MATT’s running document on the subject, and distribute those to all attendees.\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
