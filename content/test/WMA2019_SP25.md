session_title = "Parks and Recreation: Challenges of Museums Run by Parks Departments"
session_desc = "Many municipal, county and state museums are administered through their government's Parks Department.   This session will explore the challenges of working in a bureaucratic structure that is not geared towards heritage preservation, but focuses instead on recreational activities.    Presenters from museums that are under the supervision of different types of Parks Department will discuss how they have negotiated the challenges of these often mis-matched priorities to successfully maintained museum best practices."
session_unique = "While there are a great many museums that are under the administration of city, state, and county Parks Departments, there has been relatively little formal discussion of the challenges they face."
session_objectives = "This session will provide one of the first formal opportunities for the many museum professionals who report to Parks Departments to share the challenges of working in bureaucracies that are not designed to understand the needs of museums. Presentations will focus on solutions to common problems, ranging from the purely administrative, like purchasing and hiring regulations, to issues of security and collections care. Social media platforms (including SMAC's Facebook page and the AASLH Small Museum Community listserv) will be used in advance of the meeting to solicit additional concerns and solutions and, if there is interest, an online community or user group specifically for museums administered by Parks Department may be created."
engagement = "The session will consist of  short presentations followed by moderated question/discussion period which will include questions, comments and ideas that have been shared through a social media forum prior to the conference (e.g., SMAC Facebook Page, AASLH Small Museum Community listserv).  A user group or online community may be developed following the session, if there is interest. "
