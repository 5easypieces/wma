Engagement with visitors, donors, community members, and other stakeholders occurs most effectively when a museum is focused on its mission and is operating efficiently. This workshop educates museum professionals on the “nuts and bolts” of museum-specific legal issues so that their museum will operate efficiently and they can focus on their mission. Upon completing this workshop, participants will be empowered with the knowledge and legal tools to maintain relationships with stakeholders, and improve operations – all vitally important for ENGAGEMENT -- and ultimately further their museum’s mission."
