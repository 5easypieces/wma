In addition, we have reached out to Joanne Jones-Rizzi as moderator, but have not yet confirmed.  It may be that, if leadership from iPage is not able to attend, someone from an organization who has participated in iPage could present on their behalf.  Will be working to confirm in the next couple of weeks and can notify WMA once we hear back.  "
