session_desc = "This session will include presentations, a small group activity, and discussion to address incorporating high school student engagement on social issues, which includes original contributions incorporated onto the floor of museum exhibits. Examples of successful programs from the Los Altos History Museum and/ or the Oakland Museum of California, and/the Computer History Museum will be offered. In the small group activity attendees will design a workshop on social issues for high school students and brainstorm on original installations students might be able to create."
session_unique = "Garnering high school student interest and creative projects is a challenging and rewarding undertaking, one which requires significant planning, curriculum development, and community support. The Los Altos History Museum ran a unique and successful program and is eager to share practical tips and allow other museum to develop similar programs. The Oakland Museum of California and the Computer History Museum also have different types of student engagement programs, and this session will be a unique opportunity for comparison."
session_objectives = "The three main objectives of this single session include:\n \n 1) To inform the audience about Los Altos History Museum’s and Oakland Museum’s experiences—the successes and challenges—with engaging teenage youth on social issues and incorporating their creative pieces in exhibit installations.\n 2) To offer concrete examples as models for designing workshop curriculum around social issues and for facilitating creative contributions from teenage youth.\n 3) To hold open discussion on the process of incorporating high school student participation and strengths and limits of the outcomes at each museum for their respective exhibits.\n \n Potential outcomes of this single session include that panelists and audience members will have an opportunity to assess the approaches and experiences of Los Altos History Museum and Oakland Museum in working with teenage youth and consider patterns in successful teen engagement.\n \n Toward this end, the following key questions will be presented to panelists: What drew in your teenage participants? Was the social issue(s) related to the exhibit an important factor in attracting teen interest? Were the teen participants mostly interested in the chance to create an installation for the exhibit? What other factor(s) played a role in teen engagement? Another outcome of the discussion will be that, in small groups, attendees will brainstorm and begin developing a plan to include teen participation in an upcoming exhibit. \n \nTake homes include handouts of the curriculum reader, list of workshop presenters, and daily schedule prepared by LAHM Co-curators and staff as part of a workshop for high school students who learned about Juana Briones, her time period, social issues related to her life, and created projects for the exhibit Inspired by Juana: La Doña de la Frontera (October 18, 2018 – March 31, 2019). \n"

theme_relationship = "This session is directly related to the theme ENGAGE by addressing the topic of engaging high school students in museum exhibits, particularly around social issues. Many museums, including especially history museums, struggle with defining relevance and in creating genuine engagement of teenagers with the museum. This session addresses one of the most difficult audiences with which to engage, and offers a successful model of how to meaningfully allow teenagers to fully engage with an exhibition topic."
