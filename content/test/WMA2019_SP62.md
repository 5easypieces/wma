The staff at the American Indian Cultural Center & Museum is developing an exhibition that not only takes into consideration the cultural context of objects but presents their stories as beings that are imbued with a living spirit.  Session will explore the way in which tribes and the community voice express cultural contrast in giving voice to our precious objects."
