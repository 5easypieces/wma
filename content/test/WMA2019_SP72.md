session_desc = "What do you do when your program facilitators do not reflect the community you serve? Tacoma Art Museum tackled this problem head-on with an innovative strategy, hiring and training a diverse group of educators. Learn how transformed hiring practices and intensive training cultivated a corps of capable educators rooted in authentic community engagement."
session_unique = "TAM completely shifted its educational hiring practices for educators, moving away from the model used across the region, and developed our own training methods."
session_objectives = "Objectives:\nParticipants will consider the effects of hiring methods on staff diversity at their own institutions.\nParticipants will learn new techniques and models for training educators and staff.                                                                              Outcomes:\nParticipants will use lessons learned at the session to shift hiring/staffing models at their own institutions, in order to better engage the communities they serve."
engagement = "Format: Panel - Panelists will represent a broad swath of people within the museum working on this project (education, HR, senior management, etc.), moderated by a facilitator from another museum. Some portions of the panel will be interactive. Participants will receive resources to take back to their own organizations."

theme_relationship = "The model we will discuss is an example of innovative engagement with community and staff, designed to enhance diversity on staff and in programming. We intentionally hired educators who reflect our community, especially folks who have been embedded in the community for much of their lives, to better engage students and visitors. We will discuss budgetary implications (including funding priorities) and address potential ways to apply this model to institutions of various sizes and locations."
theme_comments = "We would like to include a presenter from another institution who has a similar model of hiring educators/staff from the community served with less recruiting emphasis on education & experience, and intensive training to support staff development â€“ especially an institution working with First Nations/Indigenous communities. Any help finding such a presenter would be welcomed.\nIf this session would be best merged with another session on diversity in the workforce and/or diverse hiring practices, we would be open to that."
