session_desc = "Euphemistic terms have always been used to describe the wartime incarceration of Japanese Americans. Highly charged debates over terminology continue to reflect diverse perspectives about these events.\n*A new film for Minidoka National Historic Site brings these issues into focus: how can oral history and the collective memory of survivors redefine the terminology of the incarceration?\n*Finally, recent case studies encourage future campus-community partnerships to engage students in the preservation of the Minidoka site.  "
session_unique = "Our session explores terminology usage, collective memory, oral history, and service learning as lenses of community engagement with Minidoka National Historic Site. "
session_objectives = "The first objective is to achieve a broader understanding in the field of the importance of specific terminology usage as related to the interpretation of the incarceration history. The NPS will describe why the words used for interpretation and education have a profound influence on what visitors understand about the experience of Japanese American during WWII. It is important to accurately describe the history of sites without perpetuating euphemistic terms the government created to make their actions more palatable for the general public. \n*The second objective is to explore the power of first-person testimony in deepening understanding of these incarceration sites, the potential for survivor communities to redefine the terminology used to describe their experience, and to make explicit comparisons with present-day issues. Potential outcomes include a new appreciation for the value of partner communities in interpreting controversial history, and deepening audiences' understanding of the relevance of that history. \n*The third objective is to advocate for a greater emphasis on service learning as it relates to public history students engaged in national parks, and specifically in regards to the relationship between the Master of Applied Historical Research and Service-Learning Programs at Boise State University and Minidoka NHS. This presenter explores case studies of construction management students completing the historic reconstruction of the entrance guard tower and a public history graduate student's culminating project of a walking tour mobile app. "
engagement = "A single session panel of four presenters will each discuss challenges and successes in engaging communities towards the goal of preserving and interpreting the history of Minidoka and the Japanese American incarceration from the perspectives of terminology usage, collective memory, oral history, and campus-community partnerships through service learning. Format will consist of individual presentations, audience brainstorming activities, video clip screening, and q+a."

theme_relationship = "Engagement is the central theme of this session: engaging communities in accurately defining this history, engaging incarcerees as the primary storytellers of their experience, and engaging students and young professionals to influence the site. Several communities will be discussed, including survivors, descendants, scholars, students, visitors, in addition to the partners represented on the panel and their primary constituents - the National Park Service, the philanthropic partner the Friends of Minidoka, and filmmakers at North Shore Productions."
theme_comments = "Yes, we are willing to merge if needed.\n*Rory Banyard is proposing a screening of Minidoka: An American Concentration Camp as an evening event. "
