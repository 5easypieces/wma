    reason: 'Amanda is a design coach. She collaborates with teams without the desire or resources to work consistently with consultants to cultivate a human-centered, iterative approach to problem solving in their work. She received her MA Museum Studies from the University of Leicester, with a dissertation focused on the evolving role of museums as community centers, highlighting food gardens, programs for the homeless and Museums at Night, built on her longstanding interest in creating and maintaining community. She believes that the power of visitor research is unlocked when museums go beyond measuring past successes, using it to create responsive programming.'

    reason: 'Mary Yeh is an Experience Researcher with a background in museums and non-profits. Her master&apos;s thesis "Evaluating accessibility and efficiency of museums&apos; online teacher resources" sought to understand if museums&apos; online teacher resources were created through considering teachers&apos; needs and conducting research, give a snapshot of the field, and recommend best practices for this type of audience engagement. Her current role gives her deeper understanding of research methods and practice facilitating workshops with wide audiences. She firmly believes human-centered design is essential for creating experiences that are welcoming, engaging and transformational in museums.'

working/not working. Based on our learnings, we’ll guide attendees through
activities, providing a framework for evaluating promising practices and
implementing improved approaches. We’ll gather this information through
events in the Bay Area and online (January - March 2019) to answer the
questions:
1. How do museums implement visitor research learnings?
2. What strategies have museums employed to create a culture of visitor
centered practices?
3. What are the unsolved problems?
