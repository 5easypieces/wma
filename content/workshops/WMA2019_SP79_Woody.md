description: 'The reality of working in history is that we often struggle to secure enough funding to function at our full potential. Grant funding is repeatedly sought to fill the gap needed for staff, supplies, and projects. The session will offer a sandbox for constructing competitive grant project ideas, reveal proposal pitfalls, and provide a template for creating a winning grant proposal. This workshop is for anyone who is part of an under-funded organization.'
format: 'Half-day'
fee: '$10 per participant to receive workbook that accompanies workshop.'
uniqueness: 'My workshop goes beyond the typical introduction to grants and teaches museum professionals how to construct competitive grant project ideas.'
objectives: '•	Participants will learn how to tease out potential grant project ideas by working their daily needs into a creative, and attractive grant project.
•	Participants will sandbox their grant project ideas to determine the project structure, timeline, measurables, and other necessary project facets.
•	Participants will dive into the purpose of universal proposal sections and learn to avoid proposal pitfalls.

theme_relationship: 'In order for museums to fully engage with their community they must have the resources in place to support their work. Grant funding is increasingly sought to help fill funding gaps and are becoming necessary to funding projects that the museum’s community need and want. Grant competition is increasing while available grant funding is decreasing. This workshop is intended to help provide equity to the museums who can’t afford permanent grant writing staff.'
