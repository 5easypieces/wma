1.	Participants will gain a thorough understanding of the various bodies of law affecting museum operations.
2.	Participants will learn the latest in best practices regarding legal compliance.
3.	Participants will learn how to spot legal issues relevant to museum departments and how such issues affect their operations.
4.	Participants will understand which issues are possible to be dealt with in-house and which issues are advisable to seek legal counsel.
5.	Participants will appreciate how legally compliant practices can improve fundraising, protect tax-exempt status, and ultimately improve the museum’s bottom line and ability to fulfill its mission.
Participants will benefit from well-developed reference materials specifically developed with small museums in mind.

other_comments = """Small museum administrators wear many hats and perform a wide array of tasks.  They are expected to make decisions that bind the museum legally (such as signing contracts or making statements in published materials and social media), yet they don't have access to in-house counsel or outside counsel to consult with.  Equipping small museum administrators with the legal background for matters they deal with allows them to make informed decisions, which in turn leads to a well-functioning institution able to better fulfill its mission.

This proposal for the Small Museum Legal Toolkit 2020 workshop will give small museum administrators the legal background and tools needed for them to confidently make informed decisions and to know when they should consult an expert for matters they face.  Further, this proposed program ties in nicely with next year’s theme, “Forward.”

Not in the WMA or AAM has there been a program of this kind before.  This program will benefit WMA's membership tremendously, and the written materials will provide continued value by serving as a desk reference.  This workshop is designed to be modular.  4-6 legal topics relevant to small museum operations will be covered during the course of the workshop, and the workshop may be adjusted for length to a half-day if needed, although participants will gain the most benefit from a full-day workshop.  Because of the presenters' experience and expertise in museums and as attorneys, we can cover almost any topic the WMA feels would benefit participants the most. The presenters are not promoting any commercial products or services, and intend for this workshop to contribute to the enrichment of WMA members and the betterment of the profession."""
theme_relationship = """This workshop is ideal for the 2020 theme of "Forward" because this workshop is designed to empower participants to proactively make choices to better their museum’s operations and make informed decisions to better carry out their museum's mission.
