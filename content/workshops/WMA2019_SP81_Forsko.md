theme_relationship: 'During an emergency, staff at an organization are forced to engage in ways that they may have never thought they would have to. Every part of a cultural heritage organization must be engaged in the response – from the Marketing Department to Facilities Staff to Curatorial. A cohesive response is crucial to a successful recovery, so the more involved all staff are able to be, the better for the organization.'
