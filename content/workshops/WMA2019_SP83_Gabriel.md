description: 'That some visitors feel sidelined or undermined by museums is no laughing matter. Or is it? Camp can be their means to send us up wherever they feel we are seriously missing out. Once introduced to camp methods—grounded in but moving beyond queer theory, participants will be guided through a museum by local drag queens and diverse youth, “camp counselors” modeling how to discover fresh, inclusive insights by “camping up” the museum experience. Alternative Description:

This session offers a low-cost approach for making the museum experience more appealing to audiences who may feel unacknowledged or otherwise alienated.  Using camp, an aesthetic that has ties to queer theory, we will demonstrate how “camping up” the museum experience can lead to new ways of interpreting and connecting to exhibits. With local drag queens and LGBTQ youth acting as “camp counselors,” participants will then visit a museum to try on this approach.'
format: 'Half-day'
fee: '$25/$30? Will include handouts of materials, and also will cover small honoraria to the camp counselors.'
uniqueness: 'Integrating queer issues into regular practice can feel challenging. This workshop offers a fun, innovative way to do this, focusing on diversity, youth and social media.'
objectives: '1) To welcome the LGBTQ
community and persons in their teens to their twenties— groups not always
well-reached by museums. Camp can be appropriated, however, by any kind of
visitor who feels sidelined, undermined, or left out, providing them a fun,
constructive way to address and redress exhibits and interpretations they would
like to see changed. Visitors can thus use camp to turn the possible negatives of
older standing exhibitions into sites of spontaneous, sharply witty feedback,
information museums can use for future programming, exhibition planning, and
community outreach. 

2) To offer any audience
member a humorous way to interact with the museum that can demystify and
de-serious what may be perceived as an intimidating authority. We will look at
various ways to share these insights that will drive more visitors to the
museum: on the website where people can post blogs, vlogs or selfies where they
have “camped out” in a museum; or on-site visits through fun, campy
programming.  (Every year the De Young
Museum of San Francisco invites floral artists to do arrangements in front of
art works that reflect on and interpret them. Why not a “Camping” festival?)

3)
To encourage museum professionals not to take themselves and their work too
seriously, while taking seriously visitor feedback that otherwise might be
difficult to receive. Laughter does wonders to take the edge off, even if the wit is edgy. Camp can thus allow for more open empathy and enjoyment of diverse audience reactions and experiences.'

theme_relationship: 'Participants will receive a short, accessible primer on queer theory and camp (broadening it beyond gay drag queens to any vulnerable, non-represented community). Local “camp counselors” will then demonstrate how to camp up at a local museum—poking fun with a purpose to reveal deeper insights missed by the museum. Participants will try their hand at camping out, and share take-aways. We hope later to reconvene with a drag show and cocktail soirée at a local bar, that can serve as a dual fundraiser for the WMA and a local charity chosen by the camp counselors.'
