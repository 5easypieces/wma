date: 2018-12-13 14:06:51 -0000
author: Beth Kaminsky
categories: ["Any—Professionals new to the industry", "long-time museum staff new to exhibits", "and seasoned exhibit people who want a refresher for inspiration and practice."]
tags: ["Museum and other interpretive site staff who work in any capacity on projects for users that have physical display components." ]
description: 'In this fast-paced workshop, participants will:
  Analyze “good” and “bad” labels based on various (often personal and subjective) criteria Discover ways to put visitors at the center of the process Participate in a rapid writing activity Discuss big ideas, main messages, and label frameworks Explore ways to collaborate with community advisors Share writing challenges and exercise new skills writing and rewriting labels'
format: 'Half-day '
fee: 'I’ll provide handouts, a laptop with adaptor,
and props for activities. I’ll need a projector and screen.
I don’t anticipate any additional costs.'
uniqueness: 'With thought and planning, anyone can create exhibit labels that resonate with users. Explore approaches and processes and practice doing it.'
objectives: 'Participants will leave with the tools and confidence to write readable and relevant exhibit labels for their audiences. They will have the confidence to:
 · Decipher what works and doesn’t work in exhibit labels for various visitor types and why. They will be able to recognize characteristics of readable, effective labels
 · Build thoughtful writing into the exhibit development process. Work independently or collaborate with other staff and community members on label frameworks and approaches
 · Write labels that connect exhibit topics with design and resonate with audiences in the overall museum, gallery, visitor center park, zoo, or aquarium experience'

additional_comments: 'Please note: I’m happy to reconfigure this workshop as a session (lightning pace)—please let me know if that seems a better fit. Thanks!'
other_comments: 'This workshop builds capacity for internal staff (so they don’t have to hire consultants like me).'
theme_relationship: 'Exhibit labels encourage engagement among users. Because a message isn’t a message unless it’s received, this workshop rages against obligatory text on walls. The workshop itself will engage attendees in content and activities, transmitting tools that will help them engage audiences through words in exhibit experiences.'

  reason: 'My favorite part of my job is label writing—not because it’s easy, because it’s rewarding. As a visitor, I appreciate well-written, easy to read labels that connect me (and other users) to content in three-dimensional free choice informal learning environments. Having the opportunity to share my enthusiasm with people involved in interpretation thrills me.'
