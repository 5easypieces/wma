session_objectives = """Quite often these days, you hear people start a meeting or read a web page that includes a variation of an indigenous land acknowledgement. This often includes asking local tribal representatives to “perform” a land acknowledgement by way of an opening prayer or song in ceremonial regalia, which risks continuing a negative stereotype prevalent today, with the added potential to reproduce negative legacies of the museum trope. Rather than use a standard template with tribal names inserted, land acknowledgements must be unique and may require recognizing broader uses of the land by multiple tribes over time. Simply put, these lands were once occupied by indigenous people and many indigenous people still live on and use this land today. Museums and organizations can acknowledge the original inhabitants of the land but must also seek an understanding of current tribal land claims. Panelists will engage with and evaluate the phenomenon of land acknowledgements and attendees will be given tools and ideas for thinking about them and constructing them."""
