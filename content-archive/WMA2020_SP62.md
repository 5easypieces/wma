They will also learn cost-effective methods for storage solutions, including the use of repurposed items and institutional surplus, and be introduced to the concept of creating solutions that can be used for both storage and display. Lastly, time-saving processes will be shared, including how to correctly and efficiently number garments, build one-size-fits-most boxes, and more."""
