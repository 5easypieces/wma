A large number of existing museums and historical societies within Oregon have Native American holdings but are not actively working with Tribal People to ensure that the objects are appropriately cared for, that their story is accurately portrayed or that the Tribal People have sufficient and truthful representation.  Too often, the outdated narrative of a dying, fading or eliminated Tribal presence within the community is reinforced.   This presentation is intended for museum professionals who recognize that their institutions may struggle with these issues and concepts.  The main objective of the session is to show how the specific elements of the structure and programming at Chachalu offers a pathway for encouraging dialogue and partnership between Native and non-Native communities in an effort to move away from a narrative of ‘the Past’.     A second objective is to provide museum professionals with insight into improving their own Collections Care and Interpretive Programming as it relates to their Native American belongings and visitorship (both Native and non-Native). Presenters will provide audience members with concrete examples of successful partnerships between institutions and the steps taken to achieve them.   A third objective is to empower the audience to return to their home institution ready to seek further connection with the Native People they seek to include and represent through a discussion with the audience around current goals and objectives of the Chachalu staff."""
