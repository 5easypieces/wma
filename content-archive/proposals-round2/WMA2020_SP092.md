session_objectives = """1. Empowerment: Participants will be introduced to their existing (if often untapped) capacity to act as changemakers. They will understand how personal experiences can serve as tools for institutional change and be able to identify organizational practices that inhibit collaboration or authenticity. This empowerment will disrupt the forced binary of personal and professional, letting individuals draw on strengths in both areas to advance in either. 2. Identification: Participants will leave able to clearly identify target areas and structures around them that impose specific values. This skill enables individuals to pinpoint clear opportunities and select the appropriate tactic for building more just and inclusive museums. They will be equipped to use values-driven practices to challenge reductive narratives, outdated conventions, and divisive binaries. 3. Realization: Once participants are empowered with the tools they need to make changes and have identified the target areas for implementation, they will leave equipped to build equitable structures. Participants will develop their own activity that can be applied to decrease traditional methods of engagement and increase decolonized practices across different types of organizations."""
session_engagement = """Listening and Q&A as a full group will be punctuated by opportunities to write brief personal perspectives, turn-to-your-neighbor moments, and small group dialogue. Each participant will receive a handout with the necessary prompts that they keep after the session.

This workshop considers today’s standards of equity as a minimum threshold and will give professionals the courage to move towards bolder aspirations."""
