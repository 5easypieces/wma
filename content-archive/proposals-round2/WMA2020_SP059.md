session_objectives = """Quite often these days, people open a meeting or read a web page that includes an indigenous land acknowledgement. Sometimes this includes asking local tribal representatives to provide an opening prayer or song in a tribal language or according to tribal tradition, not realizing that many tribal and Christian denominations minister on reservations today. This provides the potential to reproduce old stereotypes and negative legacies of the museum trope. Rather than use a standard template with tribal names inserted, land acknowledgements must be unique and may require recognizing broader uses of the land by multiple tribes over time. Simply put, these lands were once occupied by indigenous people and many indigenous people still live on and use this land today. Museums and organizations can acknowledge the original inhabitants of the land but must also seek an understanding of current tribal land claims. Many are confused on whose tribal (whether aboriginal, ceded, or treaty reserved) lands they are actually upon. What, if any, issues arise with state and federal museums acknowledging they exist on tribal land? Panelists will engage with these issues and evaluate the phenomenon of land acknowledgements. Attendees will be given tools for learning whose land they occupy, ideas for thinking through the acknowledgment, procedures for writing them and consulting about them. The ultimate goal is a well-constructed land acknowledgment that leads to the development of fruitful partnerships with tribes. Therefore, any attendee who wishes to work with tribes beyond the land acknowledgement will be given the tools to do so."""
session_engagement = """Session attendees will hear tribal perspectives of land acknowledgements from both tribal and non-tribal museum professionals, with discussion varying between what honors tribes and what might fail them in this process, and with heartfelt intentions, work together towards concepts of moving this current trend forward.  Takeaways will be distributed to audience members, including:  1) distributing a variety of written samples of land acknowledgements and 2) sharing guidelines for collaboration.  Attendees will learn how to find out which tribes are to be identified in a land acknowledgement and how to reach out to the appropriate tribal contacts through resources. In addition, ample time for questions and discussion between panelists and attendees will be built into the panel session and directed by the moderator."""
