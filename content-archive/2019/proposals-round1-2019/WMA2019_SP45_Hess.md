    - 'or any collections professional involved in database administration whose institution has a history of deaccessioning.'
description: 'Does your museum have a history of deaccessioning? Is your deaccessioning history incomplete, missing, or just confusing? Is the pre-digital past hard to track down or doesn''t exist at all? This session offers advice and practical step-by-step procedures for dealing with the ghosts of deaccessions past. Learn how to expand your institutional knowledge and tackle the overwhelming task of putting past deaccessions to rest. Presenters will give examples of successful projects and answer questions to help you get started.'
uniqueness: 'This session tackles a different side of deaccessioning that is rarely discussed but often encountered and offers a practical alternative to glazing over the problem.'
objectives: '* Encourage collections professionals to expand their institutional knowledge by examining the deaccessioning practices of their predecessors. * Provide clear and concise objectives and step by step procedures to make sense of and properly document bad or pre-digital deaccessions. * Illustrate the benefits of cleaning up deaccessions past for the overall health of the permanent collection and accuracy of the database.'
engagement: 'This will be a standard single session with the aim to encourage collections professionals to expand their institutional knowledge, to engage with the problems in their database, and give them the confidence to tackle bad, hastily carried out, or sometimes decades-old deaccessions. Presenters will give examples of bad deaccessions along with step-by-step procedures on how to ''''fix'' and properly document them to avoid confusion for their successors, followed by plenty of time for Q&A.'
additional_comments: 'I need help finding presenters! My museum (Bowers Museum) is a world art museum, with a collection of over 80,000 in both ethnographic and fine art with a foundation in local history. Presenters from different institutions (larger or smaller, contemporary, natural history, etc.) with a history of deaccessioning or a desire to provide an example for case study would be ideal for this session. I am also very open to input on the session description & advice on how to make it more engaging & exciting.'

theme_relationship: 'This session relates to the conference theme by encouraging collections professionals to take a more active role in contributing to the overall efficacy and accuracy of their collection & database by ENGAGE-ing & learning when faced with a problem rather than passing it on to their future successors.'
