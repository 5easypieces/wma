description: "The collective response of our society to climate change will be one of the defining issues of this era.  From strategies to improve the environmental performance of facilities, to making a difference globally through programs such as We Are Still In, this session will explore the causes and issues surrounding climate change and provide insights on how museums of all varieties can contribute to bringing positive change to their organizations and communities.  "
uniqueness: "Society's response to climate change will be one of the defining issues of this era, yet it is not adequately discussed within the museum community."
objectives: "1. Understanding Climate Change * In order to solve the problems surrounding climate change, we must attain a better understanding of what climate change means to our society. * Identify the key causes of climate change. * Understand how we have played a role in the causes of climate change and how we can play a role in solving these problems. 2. Take Action--Improving your Environmental Footprint * Understand the impact your own facility and programs have on the environment and how the negative effects can be mitigated. * Building resilience from within while minimizing operational costs. * Explore different strategies to improve the performance of all buildings and sites--from new construction to renovations to existing facilities. 3. Take Action--Inspiring Others * Museums must align the abilities, resources, and influence of our sector, with the work and resources of other sectors, to help our communities understand their connection to environment and climate, and to prepare for a changing climate. * Museums can use education, research, and communication to foster individual, collaborative and collective action, from every sector, to pursue an inclusive agenda for significant environment and climate impact. * Museums are the best-equipped organizations to share these messages."
engagement: 75-minute single session * The session will feature presentations on a variety of issues surrounding climate change and how museums can take action to mitigate the impacts of climate change, build resilience, and inspire their audience to take action.  There will be resources and take-aways for all levels of museum professionals, including practical strategies to implement and big picture ideas to inspire change within their organizations and communities.  There will be ample time for Q&A."
