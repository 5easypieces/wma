description: 'Engage in a round-table discussion focused on the issues facing women and gender-nonconforming
museum workers, build community, and identify practical solutions for
museum workers of all professional levels.'

community as well as create actionable steps for participants to take away.'
objectives: '1. Build community within the issues facing women and gender-non-conforming museum
workers by identifying common ground as well as areas where participants can be greater
allies to each other.
2. Identify root causes of these issues within organizations/workplaces by picking apart and
discussing the research and common experiences.
3. Brainstorm practical solutions and actionable next-steps for combating these issues in
ways that are appropriate for all genders and career levels.'
engagement: 'A round-table discussion and group work (depending on attendance) to pick apart issues
facing women and gender-non-conforming museum workers as well as brainstorming
practical solutions and actionable steps for all career/power levels.'

presenters!'

theme_relationship: 'In order for museums to realize their full potential as a social good and a community
member in its own right, leaders will have to grapple with issues of representation in their
ranks. This session will address how museum workers can be agents of change in their
institutions, creating positive and inclusive work environments, and promote gender
diversity on their staff and boards.'
