  There is increasing awareness of the need for museums to share the stories of
  people of all backgrounds. How do we tell the stories of people of color,
  differing religious backgrounds, ethnicities and orientations' How do we tell
  these stories in the context of controversy, crime or social justice? This
  session will uncover how to make institutions more inclusive through
  thoughtful interpretation.
uniqueness: >-
  Museums must navigate through difficult topics in order to become inclusive in
  an era where social justice is increasingly relevant.
objectives: >-
  1. Identify opportunities to make your institution more inclusive and what the
  potential controversies are in sharing those stories thoughtfully.

  2. Discuss how to properly implement interpretive exhibits, programs or events
  with the help of outside scholars and community engagement.

  3. Discuss methods of audience evaluation after your project is opened or
  completed. Are museum professionals prepared for honest feedback from
  visitors?
engagement: >-
  Because this session is based on experience with interpreting difficult
  topics, it will be primarily presentation and discussion based, with
  presenters using PowerPoint and audio-visual elements to reflect on experience
  with a specific exhibit at the Old Idaho Penitentiary and other issues the
  panelists have faced at the Idaho Black History Museum and the Minidoka
  National Historic Site. Audience members will be given questions to discuss
  with each other and the panelists.
additional_comments: >-
  This could certainly be merged with another session if needed. I would be
  happy to coordinate with presenters and adjust those needs if necessary.

theme_relationship: >-
  This session approaches inclusivity as a way to allow all visitors to become
  connected with museums on a deeper level. The best way for museums to engage
  audiences is through relevant storytelling that presents topics in new and
  thought-provoking ways, and may even reach visitors no previous connection to
  the institution.
