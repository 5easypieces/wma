description: "The academic museum has an opportunity to create a model for all museums to provide new and meaningful learning experiences for students, faculty, and the diverse communities they serve. This session includes presentations by three speakers from academic museums opening collections spaces in innovative and unconventional ways. Through interdisciplinary partnerships, new ways of thinking and interpretation ultimately enrich higher education and integrate a museum into student life, faculty teaching practices, and transfers to communities beyond campus borders."
uniqueness: "Unconventional access and collaboration encourage academic museums to shift to a community-driven hub and provides a model for all types of museums. The session's moderator will talk about how these academic examples can translate to non-academic museums."
objectives: "1. Gaining the knowledge needed to start opening a museum's collection to non-traditional partners
*2. Looking at three to four case studies of museums practicing extraordinary collections access successfully
*3. To learn more about unconventional partnerships that your museum hasn?t thought about yet (how to look for connections through your collections)"
engagement: "1. 10 minutes: Introduction of topic and structure of session by a moderator.
*2. 15 minutes each (for 3 speakers): Participating speakers will detail their museum's unique collections access, give a few examples of successful collections partnerships, and 
*3. 10 minutes: Conclusion and list of takeaways by moderator
*4. 10 minutes: question and answer period from the audience"
additional_comments: "I do need help in finding presenters. I have a large list of academic museums that would be suitable to speak due to the fact that my thesis deals specifically with academic museums. My list is art museum-heavy and it is possible that I will have further options once I conduct more interviews for my thesis this coming January.  I would be willing to merge with another session if it makes sense.
*Other speaker suggestions:
*1. Minetti Shrem Museum at UC Davis - contact would be Jennifer Wagelie  jjwagelie@ucdavis.edu 
*2. SFMOMA - (non-academic) Artist Initiative: Curatorial, Conservation, and Education Department collaboration - Robin Clark, Director rclark@sfmoma.org 
*a. If the above speaker was included, I would also include CSU East Bay - Professor Jason Smith - he would be presenting on how SFMOMA has helped develop a collaborative approach to students viewing art to enrich their medical humanities education"
other_comments: "This is a valuable session with relevant takeaways to empower professionals from any of the above areas to return to their individual museums and start prototyping a multifaceted collections access program"
theme_relationship: "This session may touch upon the following themes of the conference:  Unconventional and innovative partnerships, Museums as inclusive places, Museums as agents of social change / social justice, Storytelling to engage new audiences, Activism in museums"

  is_confirmed: TRUE
  is_presenting: FALSE
  reason: My thesis focuses on interdisciplinary object-based learning in academic museums. I am interested in non-traditional fields of study visiting academic museums to enhance a student?s learning within their fields as well as create collaborative ways of re-interpreting collections. Meaning-making is important during this process as well as syllabus connections which are not always easy to make. The interdisciplinary nature of collection exploration provides an enriching experience and enhances skillsets to better tackle traditional study content. In my Master?s studies, I am emphasizing in Curatorial Practice and Education. My hope is to continue the work that I have done in my internships relating to collaboration in collections exploration and interdisciplinary connections to collections.

  first_name: Nicole
  last_name: Balsdon, BSc
  title: Education & Outreach Coordinator
  organization: Beatty Biodiversity Museum at the University of British Columbia
  city: 
  primary_email: nicole.balsdon@ubc.ca
  secondary_email: 
  telephone: 604 822 3320
  is_confirmed: FALSE
  reason: I interviewed Nicole as one of my thesis content experts. The projects and initiatives that the Beaty is doing in order to engage students and faculty across all disciplines at UBC are amazing. The Beaty benefits from an almost completely open and state-of-the-art collection space which doubles up as their exhibition space. Nicole is incredibly knowledgeable and solutions-oriented, holds a BSc, is part of an independent museum group for Vancouver, and has been with the Beaty since 2010.

  secondary_email: 
  telephone: 310.443.7047
  is_confirmed: FALSE
  reason: I have not spoken to Theresa yet - she is on my list to interview her for my thesis in January 2019. I attended a session at the AAMG 2018 conference in Miami by Claudia Bestor (Director of Public Programs) and really liked what the Hammer was doing in terms of reaching out to the general public and involving students in unconventional ways. The Hammer Museum is not only a hub for students, but a place for the surrounding community to be involved in politics and contemporary art. I think Teresa would be an excellent presenter on how the Hammer is engaging with students and faculty in collaborative projects.
presenter_3:
  first_name: Aimee
  last_name: Shapiro / or Cantor representative (this position is currently open so there isn?t a name to give)
  title: Director of Programming and Engagement (Aimee)
  organization: Anderson Collection (Art focused) | Cantor Arts Center, Stanford University (Cultural and Art focused)
  city: 
  primary_email: aimees@stanford.edu
  secondary_email: 
  telephone: 650-721-6055
  is_confirmed: FALSE
  reason: The two museums at Stanford University have a mission to ?Serv[e] the Stanford campus, the Bay Area community, and visitors from around the world, the Cantor Arts Center provides an outstanding cultural experience for visitors of all ages.? The collaboration with Stanford students from all fields of study takes place in both museums (more so in the Cantor, but the Anderson is still growing its programming). The university set a goal to create an Arts District which includes the Cantor Arts Center, The Anderson Collection, The Bing Concert Hall and the McMurtry Art and Art History Departments.  The museums are now a community destination for students, faculty, and the surrounding (and international) visitors. Collaboration is what drives the museums to engage and work with the campus community to create diverse and inclusive programming and access to their collections.
