description: "Museum stores are often the last place one visits when at an institution, and extending the museum experience by making children and school group visits in the museum store can be Show and Tell worthy.  How the child is treated and what they carry home can leave a lasting impression on how memories are made."
uniqueness: "Few professional sessions have focused on kids in the museum stores, and how that visit can shape the museum impact for children, educators, and chaperones as well as the profits from sales."
objectives: "* Crowd control by creating 'kid zones,' altering your floor plan, and tips and tricks for moving school groups out quickly. * Staff and volunteer tips on creating a welcoming environment for families and school groups, extending the visit even if nothing is bought. * Working with museum educators to ensure your mix of merchandise is aligned with the mission of your education team"
engagement: "Power Point presentation, video clips, a touch of humor, currently at 55 minutes including Q&A, but can be expanded or edited if needed"
additional_comments: "Can merge if it's appropriate"
other_comments: "Anyone who works with school groups or families"
theme_relationship: "How to engage the young visitors and school groups in the museum store even if they are not there to buy.  Setting the comfort level that makes kids want to come back to your institution, ask questions, open books, and look through telescopes."
