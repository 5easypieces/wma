  Collaborative partnerships allow museums to reimagine themselves as spaces
  that are responsive and relevant to their communities. Collaborations with
  partners with different areas of expertise deepen the impact of our work and
  engage new and nontraditional audiences.

  they have pursued and how these collaborations root their institutions in
  their diverse communities, triggering new audiences to connect to the museum
  through shared dialogue and experience.

  This session explores the ways collaborative community partnerships can
  enhance community engagement for cultural institutions. Collaborative programs
  offer museums opportunities for greater relevance and relatability within
  their communities. Collaborating not only engages museum staff with other
  ideas and professional practices, but also engages a wider section of our
  community by providing a space for dialogue on contemporary social, political
  and environmental issues and ideas of importance.
