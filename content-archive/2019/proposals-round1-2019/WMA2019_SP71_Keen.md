    Institutions with a site-specific focus or attendees who are interested in
    learning tools for developing a site-specific program and visitor
    experience.
description: >-
  Site-specific interpretation provides an authentic experience of place and
  creates a powerful lens into the legacy of an individual or cultural group.
  Providing visitors with a contextual experience is accomplished through
  methods tailored to each site’s unique characteristics. This idea will be
  explored in detail through four locations: the Basque Block Museum and
  Cultural Center, James Castle House, Hemingway House and Preserve, and the
  Suquamish Cultural District.
uniqueness: >-
  These four sites are distinct examples of place specificity and demonstrate
  how a site integrates and evokes history, museum content and visitor
  experience.
objectives: >-
  **Explore Site-Specific Interpretation:** This session will explore
  interpretive and contextual approaches to institutions and districts that
  engage in site-specific and experiential ways. These include


  1. the Basque Block, including the Basque Museum and Cultural Center, that
  occupies an urban block in Boise surrounded by immigrant-owned businesses; 

  2. James Castle House interpretive exhibits featuring work by outsider artist
  James Castle and rotating artists in residence; 

  3. the Hemingway House and Preserve; and

  4. the Suquamish Cultural District comprised of the Suquamish Museum and House
  of Awakened Culture, host of tribal canoe journey landings and events like
  “Sovereign Style”, a contemporary interpretation of traditional native
  fashion. 


  _Outcome:_ Participants will be inspired to apply to their own visitor
  engagement strategies.


  **Create a Dialog on Cultural Equity:** The four case studies will present an
  unlikely combination of subjects that address artistic creation and living
  culture through the lens of immigration, disability, mental health and
  historically oppressed people. Each of these case studies will foster a forum
  for a conversation on accessibility, representation, contemporary perception,
  stigma and personal voice. 


  _Outcome:_ Participants will think about these issues in fresh ways that may
  inform programs at their institutions. 


  **Share Experience of Northwest Cultural Institutions and Districts: **This is
  an opportunity to compare and contrast four cultural sites that are unique to
  Idaho and the Northwest region. 


  _Outcome:_ WMA conference participants may wish to visit and learn from their
  own experience at some of these interpretive environments and gain a
  contextual understanding of these places.
engagement: >-
  Modified Ignite Format Combined with a Moderated Panel: The moderator will
  introduce the session and provide contextual and conceptual themes for panel
  discussion. Key participants will share four case study examples with
  projected images in a modified “Ignite” format, 5 – 8 minutes each. Audience
  members are encouraged to write questions to ask panelists. Moderator
  facilitates Q & A between audience and panel.
additional_comments: >-
  While the James Castle House and Basque Museum and Cultural Center may enter
  proposals for other sessions, the content for those sessions is different than
  what would be presented in this session. The speakers would also different so
  there will be no scheduling conflicts.

theme_relationship: >-
  All case studies demonstrate strong community ENGAGEMENT. The Hemingway House
  and Preserve is managed by a community library; James Castle House is managed
  by the City of Boise; the Suquamish Museum and Cultural District is managed,
  programmed and operated by the Suquamish people; and Basque Block is managed
  by a non-profit organization for immigrants. Additionally, there public
  engagement opportunities are connected to each of these examples—an
  artist-in-residence program, an international cultural festival, national
  seminars and events that promote traditional life ways and living culture.
