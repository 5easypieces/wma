  Does your museum need budget-friendly directions to improve its community
  engagement, address challenges with collections, strengthen its educational
  activities, align operations overall, or hone its governance for greater
  leadership potential? The Museum Assessment Program can give your museum the
  best route to reach your destination. Hear about the new and revised
  assessment options; and the benefits, experience, and results of MAP from
  recent participants. Fuel up to apply for this IMLS funded excellence program
  today.
uniqueness: >-
  While it been running for 37 years, every year MAP still engages museums that
  have never participated before, and/or have never heard of the program. 
objectives: >-
  After coming to this session, attendees will:


  * Understand MAP process and what the new/revised assessments and aspects of
  the process/program are

  * Be motivated to apply for MAP

  * Understand value of self and peer assessment as a way to engage with the
  larger field and strengthen the organization, so it can better serve its
  community and stakeholders.
engagement: >-
  This 75-minute session features a combination of basic information about MAP
  (steps, options, cost, etc.) delivered by the Program Officer, followed by a
  conversational discussion between the PO and two recent program participants
  about their MAP experiences. The bulk of the session focuses on the latter.
  Attendees will be able to ask questions during and at the end of the session.
  They will leave with a handout summarizing assessments, costs, timing, and
  deadline.

theme_relationship: >-
  In addition to all the MAP assessments themselves (Organizational, Community
  Engagement, Collections, Education, Leadership) the nature of the process
  creates internal and external engagement experiences for the museum. The
  self-assessment forces staff and board members to work together and engage
  deeply with museum's core mission. The site visit connects the museum with a
  peer, exposing them to standards and best practices. Overall MAP gives museums
  the opportunity to engage with the broader museum community.
