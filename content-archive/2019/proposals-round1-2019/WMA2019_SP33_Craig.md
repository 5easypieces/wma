  Can practicing empathy evolve museums from 'paper' diversity plans to
  meaningful change? This panel explores how very different museums have
  implemented changes after participating in The Empathetic Museum workshop
  offered at WMA 2018. What tools have been useful in creating more equitable
  and inclusive museums? If your museum is struggling to engage your full
  community, you can benefit from this session as we define strategies to put to
  use and common pitfalls to avoid.
uniqueness: >-
  The session will be innovative because we will involve our audience in
  reflecting as individuals and as organizations.
objectives: >-
  After attending this session participants will


  1. Be able to place their organization within the Maturity Model; _
  Participants will understand that creating 'diversity' isn't about checking
  boxes or counting up 'minorities.' Instead, we seek to redistribute power in
  making key decisions that define our collections, exhibits, programs and all
  strategic and programmatic activities. _ define key terms _ the use and misuse
  of 'diversity plans' _ we each have a role, and a bias.

  2. Be inspired to initiate new equity and inclusion activities in their
  strategic planning and daily work; _ Empathy can be practiced and improved.
  And, becoming a more empathetic museum is good for your museum and your
  community (and the world!). Get started by developing a vocabulary, building a
  list of resources, and learning about the efforts at work in other museums.
  We'll use the Calls to Action defined in **Facing Change** to start your
  efforts today._

  3. Know how to avoid common pitfalls that occur in museums who are trying to
  do the 'right thing,' but result in further alienating constituencies. 
  Concrete takeaways show how successful strategies can drive attendance and
  funding, while taking no action or attempting well-meaning, but short-sighted
  activities have the opposite effect.



  Outcomes:


  1. Increased interest and competency in developing and implementing DEI Plans
  (increase skills; flood the market)

  2. Increase in quality and quantity of 2020 WMA session and workshop proposals
  for DEI at multiple stages of development and implementation (proliferation of
  sharing experiences and strategies)

  Single Session Panel with Break Out Time


  1. Intro/Icebreaker, Lisa Sasaki--Intro to Facing Change and other resources.
  Stacey and/or Janeen -  ask audience to 'think and write', then 'pair and
  share' how their institution fits the Maturity Model (MM). Explain diversity
  dilemmas for end of session.

  2. Panelists define their museum's MM and offer progress and pitfalls

  3. General Q & A 4. Divide into three groups, discuss a diversity dilemma at
  each

  1. If internet connectivity allows, Bryant and/or Mann will participate during
  the introduction of the session via Skype. (They are unable to commit to
  in-person visit at this time). If internet capability is not available, Ann
  will pre-record a virtual introduction with them and play it for the audience.
  The purpose of this is to ensure that Mann and Bryant are properly credited
  for their work, avoiding joining the prevalent pattern of racially biased
  citations (Ray, V. Inside Higher Ed, 27 April 2018).

  2. I invited Patrick McMahon from the Gates Foundation Discovery Center as the
  third panelist. After careful consideration, the organization will not be able
  to participate. However, I am confident I can locate a third panelist who
  either participated in the workshop or is practicing the work of equity,
  inclusion, and accessibility. I am open to any recommendations from the
  committee.

  Yes. If museums are to truly 'engage' with their communities, then they must
  be representative of and by those communities. Understanding the perspectives
  and experiences of 'others' and bringing observation to our own biases is not
  only critical to engaging people in the museum environment, but also crucial
  to next steps in our collective human experience.

    I invited Sasaki to moderate this session because of her role as a member of
    the Facing Change working group. Facing Change is a 2018 report summarizing
    insights from AAM?s Diversity, Equity, Accessibility, and Inclusion working
    group. I had originally invited Stacey Mann and Janeen Bryant, presenters in
    the 2018 pre-conference Empathetic Museum workshop, but they are not
    available to attend in person and therefore it seemed best for them to be
    included in an introductory role.

    Bryant and Mann were co-presenters of the 2018 WMA pre-conference workshop
    The Empathetic Museum. They are unable to confirm in-person attendance at
    WMA 2019, but hope to participate via Skype or through a pre-recorded
    introduction to kick off the panel session.
