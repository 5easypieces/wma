session_title = "Stronger Together: Creating Exhibitions Through Museum Partnerships"
session_desc = "\"Our museum is way overstaffed!\" said no museum professional ever. With a tight budget and lean staff, how can cultural institutions produce robust, complex exhibitions? Museum partnerships offer opportunities to create stronger exhibitions than a single institution can alone produce. This session offers a case study of an exhibition co-organized by the Buffalo Bill Center of the West and Gilcrease Museum, and also includes strategies gleaned from a variety of museum partnerships from across the country.

session_type = "Standard panel (2 or more panelists)"
session_unique = "As co-curators from two museums working together (and mostly remotely) in equal partnership on a major project, we largely created processes from scratch. This session shares a distinct model of a co-produced exhibition."
session_objectives = " · Why form a museum partnership in the first place? Using the project \"Albert Bierstadt: Witness to a Changing West\" as a key case study, presenters will explore the benefits of creating an exhibition through a partnership between two or more museums: sharing collections, sharing staff resources, increased creative potential, securing venues and loans for traveling exhibitions with increased ease, dual name recognition, etc. · Too many cooks in the kitchen? This session will also discuss the challenges of exhibition partnerships, and how to negotiate potential pitfalls. · This session will demonstrate one of many benefits of professional networking: getting to know your colleagues (read: potential partners)! Building relationships through personal interactions at museum conferences, symposia, exhibition openings, and other events can help grow your roster of co-conspirators. · By exploring both the Bierstadt project and a selection of other notable museum partnerships, this session will provide participants with tips and templates for sustaining effective museum partnerships by offering perspectives on collaborative brainstorming, formalizing partnerships through contractual agreements, co-authoring budgets, seeking granting opportunities, and co-producing content, interpretation, and marketing materials—and will underscore the importance of regular communication throughout the process. · The session will include at least two sample project planning documents as tangible take-aways: a sample partnership contract, a sample project timeline, and possibly a list of additional resources & recommendations. "
engagement = "First, presenters will introduce the exhibition \"Albert Bierstadt: Witness to a Changing West\" as a detailed case study. Presenters will then briefly highlight a diverse selection of other recent exhibition collaborations, sharing strategies for highly effective museum exhibition partnerships gleaned from the museum field at large. Finally, presenters will set aside 15-20 minutes for discussion with the audience. The session will also include sample project planning documents as handouts."

other_comments = "This session has two presenters, the co-curators for \"Albert Bierstadt: Witness to a Changing West\" from the Buffalo Bill Center of the West and Gilcrease Museum, respectively. While we plan to present our Bierstadt project as a key case study, we also plan to interview colleagues at other institutions who have worked in exhibition partnerships to gain additional insights. We are hoping to hear from colleagues at both large and small institutions, potentially including the Denver Art Museum, Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, Museum of Glass in Tacoma, and the Wichita Museum. If the Program Committee has suggestions for other museums to consult about recent exhibition partnerships, we'd love additional recommendations. Thanks!"

Karen and Laura teamed up to produce the exhibition title, press release, exhibition text, video content for the exhibition, and two essays for the catalogue. As the two partners who worked most closely together to create this project, we lacked a clear model from other institutions and in many cases established our own processes for managing the project. Together we hope to share our process, including successes, potential pitfalls, and lessons learned."
