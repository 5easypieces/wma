session_desc = "In this interactive session, presenters will use their (vastly) different experiences as new mothers at 5+ institutions to examine relevant issues. Learn about new ideas to such as \"onboarding\" new parents. Then work collectively with other participants to explore creative strategies to ensure museums have systems in place to achieve both what's best for the museum and for their staff. We'll focus on parent-hood, but conversations will apply more broadly to any work/life balance."

session_objectives = "1) Expose museum professionals to a variety of responses from institutions regarding maternity leave/parenthood in the museum to offer insight into some of the successes/problems in this area. Attendees will learn new ideas, many of which are easy to integrate, such as \"onboarding\" new parents when they return to work, the creation of a \"mom\" or \"new parent\" group that meets monthly, the education of managers about expectations for parents during leave/returning to work, how to examine a job and determine if on-site/off-site duties can be modified to allow for greater work-from-home, etc. 2) Through meaningful group discussions, explore both goals for museums to meet in this area and options for how to achieve those goals. We feel that this topic is both ubiquitous and overlooked. As a ubiquitous topic, the attendees at this session will be able to contribute their own ideas, insights, and experiences to the conversation. However, it is an overlooked topic that may not often be discussed in a professional setting, making it all the more important to dedicate a healthy portion of this session to group discussion. As a whole, we hope to further develop the list of possible \"creative solutions\" to this \"problem of parenthood,\" as well as working to expand perspectives about this topic. Open a forum for discussion on this topic thatcan be revisited in other formats/future meetings. Handouts will include information highlightingstate laws regarding maternity/paternity leave in each of the states WMArepresents. Additional resources forthose wishing to pursue advocacy will be available."
engagement = "Session will be a mix of PechaKucha to introduce some ideas, Spectogram to allow for participants to share their experiences and make meaningful groups for an Unconference-style discussion with some thoughtful prompts designed to help participants leave the session with a plan of action. State-specific resources will also be made available regarding maternity leave and other pertinent information."

other_comments = "We would definitely be willing to merge with another presenter/group. We are actively seeking other presenters, particularly an Executive Director who could give additional perspective on what it is like to be a mother in a leadership role. 1) While what we talk about in this session will apply more broadly to parenthood, caring for an aging parent, or any kind of work life balance, we would like to stick with a focus on mothers. Firstly, we will be women presenting, so we can speak from our experience, and that will provide us with a solid foundation to branch out into the various issues that affect museum professionals as mothers. Additionally, although things are progressing so that more and more people see the father as an equal partner in the parenting game that still isn't always the case. We would like to use a portion of the presentation to situate current issues in their historical context: treatment of women in the workplace and how things have progressed to show that while there has been change, there are still ways to improve. And that the rising cost of living combined with student loan debt has attributed to needing two incomes in many households. We will hit on the issue of low pay and non-flexibility in many museums that has led to women leaving the field so that we aren't grooming the next generation of leaders. We hope to have some statistical data to discuss the lack of women in leadership, though the field is dominated by women, and explore the link between this and motherhood. There are also some unique differences between motherhood and fatherhood/other family responsibilities that we would like to address specifically (e.g. breastfeeding, postpartum care, \"mom guilt,\" maternal mental load). Additionally, we will work to compile some information about \"parent's rights\" or other relevant info specific to each state represented by WMA. We recognize that people may be motivated to make changes but not sure what direction to take and hope that by doing some of the legwork that will get them moving and perhaps help people to make some more specific advocacy push within their institution/state/state organizations. 2) One of our goals for the session is how to think creatively aboutparental leave and healthy work environments for parents that is not just aboutwhat is allowed by the law etc. Glenda at SFMOMA has started implementingsome new ideas and can speak to their effectiveness. Thus far the presenters seem to have verydifferent experiences with what worked/didn't work and can share some of thatexperience. This is also an area in which feedback and participation from theaudience will add a great deal to the meaningful takeaways for the sessionattendees as a whole. "
