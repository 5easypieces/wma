session_desc = "In a culture of speed museums are ideal spaces to slow down, reflect, and connect to ourselves and others. A mental health professional who specializes in mindfulness, and educators from three institutions, Crocker Museum in Sacramento, University of Colorado Art Museum in Boulder, and Los Angeles County Museum of Art, will define mindfulness and share varied approaches to successful mindfulness programs, including slow looking and meditation. Participate in a mindfulness exercise, get tips for implementing programs, and brainstorm with peers in break-out groups."

session_unique = "This session highlights a variety of mindfulness techniques for multiple audiences in a museum setting, and is designed to offer practical, hands-on advice and brainstorming."
session_objectives = " Interest in mindfulness has grown exponentially in the last decade. Studies have shown numerous health and societal benefits. At their core, museums provide a space for visitors to pause. Facilitated experiences, including slow looking, discussions, meditation, and creative responses, encourage visitors to carefully look, engage in conversation, and learn about diverse viewpoints. The programs foster connections, belongingness, and compassionâ€”capacities at the center of the human experience and vital for mental health and well-being. Although the examples in this panel will be from art museums, the techniques shared are applicable to any museum, botanical garden, zoo, and historical site. The aim of this session is to introduce mindfulness, present examples of programming, and to give participants the tools to brainstorm and plan mindfulness programs, either by incorporating into existing programming or starting a new program. In this session: -A mental health professional will define mindfulness and will discuss the benefits of the practice. -Museum educators will present successful programs that incorporate mindfulness and meditation in front of works of art as an opportunity for contemplation, reflection, and compassion. In addition, they will offer tips to tailor the programming to other museum collections or gardens. -Participants will gain tips for planning, and implementation, including finding outside partnerships. -Participants will learn several mindfulnesstechniques."
engagement = "The session will begin with a mindfulness exercise, followed by short panel presentations, guided break-out groups to brainstorm ways to implement mindfulness programming, time for questions, share-out and reflection, concluding with an additional mindfulness technique. The break-out groups will be facilitated by the presenters and will include resource guides. Participants will get specific tips on starting new programs, or incorporating mindfulness into existing programming, even if they do not have personal experience with mindfulness or meditation."
