engagement = "Panel/discussion Panelists represent a range of people within the museum, moderated by a facilitator from another museum. After panel presentation, participants will self-select into small groups to discuss potential barriers to implementation, facilitated by panelists.

An opt-in email group will continue the conversation. "

We intentionally hired educators who reflect our community, especially folks who have been embedded in the community for much of their lives, to better engage students and visitors. We will discuss budgetary implications (including funding priorities) and address potential ways to apply this model to institutions of various sizes and locations."
theme_comments = "We would like to include a presenter from another institution who has a similar model of hiring educators/staff from the community served with less recruiting emphasis on education & experience, and intensive training to support staff development â€“ especially an institution working with First Nations/Indigenous communities. Any help finding such a presenter would be welcomed. If this session wouldbe best merged with another session on diversity in the workforce and/ordiverse hiring practices, we would be open to that."
