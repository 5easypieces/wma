Does it feel impossible for yourmuseum to be an advocate for social justice issues? This session is informed bythe growing movement of museums and museum professionals working to dispelthe myth of institutional neutrality or nonpartisanship , the reality of museumprofessionals who can't overtly address controversial topics, and a belief that'museums are places that are quietly subversive.'"

session_objectives = "The intended audience for this session includes those who engage visitorsand/or audiences at small or rural museums and/or any museum locatedin politically conservative communities. Based on examples given by thepresenters and audience members, participants will develop their ownideas about how to bring more inclusive practices and audienceengagement techniques to museums of all sizes, disciplines, andgeographic locations. Participants should glean at least a couple ofconcrete ideas that they could try to implement in their museum.2) Participants will develop a sense of community and shared purpose bymeeting other professionals who are struggling with the very samechallenges of how to engage in diversity, equity, accessibility andinclusion work when they are being told by their boss or their board thatthey can't do anything partisan at work, anything that takes a stance on aparticular issue, or sometimes, even express an opinion outside of work.By growing their network, participants will gain new resources to call uponwhen they are back in their museum and encounter a challenge whentrying to advance inclusion in their institution.3) By going beyond the foundational concept that no organization or personis neutral, the session will investigate the unique realities faced by smallermuseums and/or museums located in rural or conservative communities.Participants and presenters will expand the conversation popularized bymovements such as #museumsarenotneutral to explore various ways in which the embodiment of equity and decolonization work manifestsdifferently in those institutions than it does in museums in largeprogressive urban areas. Session leaders will provide tools and insightson how to push back and reconcile criticism, and provide tools forlearning how to shake up the structure and dynamics of their museums byusing more nuanced approaches to 'position' and 'tone' withoutacquiescing to cries for 'civility.'"
